            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170662:10"/> he did that againſt thoſe of our Profeſsion in the dayes of old: <hi>The portion of the Egyptian Prieſts (that ſerved the Oxe, the Ape, and the Onion,) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped ſale in time of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> Learned <hi>Junius</hi> (in his Academia, Chap. <hi>4.</hi>) ſayes, that the <hi>Philiſtines ſpared the Schooles of the Prophets in their Warrs with Iſrael:</hi> and that the <hi>Phoenicians, Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Indians were tender over ſuch places:</hi> Thus then did God reſtraine the ſpirits of Princes: yet that God (who in his own Law, <hi>Lev. 25.32. gave the Levits a ſpecial priviledg of redeeming Lands</hi> (ſold by themſelves) <hi>at any time,</hi> when
<pb facs="tcp:170662:10"/> other Tribes were limited to a ſet Time) hath not ſtayed the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people againſt us, but that our portions are ſold unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>without Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt acknowledg, that Gods word hath taken hold of us, <hi>Zec. 1.5.</hi> That the Lord hath deviſed a device againſt us, hath watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us; For, under the whole heaven hath not been done, as hath been done upon Jeruſalem, <hi>Dan. 9.14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us not flatter our ſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly! The puniſhment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the ſin, as the wax the ſeal, and as the Mould owns the Figure: And let us own both. It is very dangerous to bleſſe our ſelves too boldly; God has curſed our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:11"/> 
                     <hi>Mal. 2.2.</hi> And that he may bleſſe to us our very Curſes; Let us take with us words and ſay, To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes, and multiplyed pardons; to us ſhame and confuſion, as at this day. The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way to get what belongs to God, is, to take to our ſelves what belongs to us. If we would Judge your ſelves, and every man, knowing the plague of his own heart, lay Gods Dealing to heart; and accepting of our puniſhment, give glory to God, and humble our ſelves under his mighty hand; then ſhall God exalt us, and accept us and take away our Reproach.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhall confeſſe our ſins, that like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> we have
<pb facs="tcp:170662:11"/> been Brethren in evil, have broken the Covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> have done violence to, and been partial in the law, have made our ſelves vile, and therefore are juſtly, by God, made contemptible and baſe before the people, <hi>Mal. 2.</hi> If wee ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that wee neither underſtood nor valued our High and Holy Calling as Chriſtians, much leſſe as Miniſters of Chriſt; That we did not thrive kindly, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had planted and watered us in <hi>thoſe Horns of Oyl, the two Univerſities;</hi> or removed us into <hi>Countrey Cures,</hi> we did not fructifie (as this Book will ſhew) in any proportion to his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; therfore are juſtly caſhie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of his ſervice, and ſtript of
<pb facs="tcp:170662:12"/> his Rewards: God is faithfull and juſt to forgive us: For, <hi>Job 33.27.</hi> He looks upon men; if any ſay, I have ſinned, I have perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his ſoul from the pit, his life ſhall ſee the light.</p>
                  <p>And now, let none think, that this Confeſsion will give advantage to the Adverſary; They may take, where none is given: They may ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified:</hi> By their own confeſsion, <hi>we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not, though we devour them, becauſe they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Juſtice,</hi> Jer. <hi>50.7.</hi> But they will finde at laſt, That to forſake the Levite is a ſin; That
<pb facs="tcp:170662:12"/> it is a bitter thing to <hi>Help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction,</hi> when <hi>God is but a little diſpleaſed:</hi> That Jeruſalem will be a cup of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a burdenſome ſtone to every one that cryes but <hi>Downe with it.</hi> Woe to thee, O Aſſur, the Rod of Gods anger; The ſtaffe in thine hand is Gods Indignation. Thou, Lord, haſt ordained him for judgment, and eſtabliſhed him for correction; Even for Our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to purifie Us ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> from our droſſe; (Howbeit, hee meaneth not ſo) and by his hand, who puniſheth us not onely for that which is ſin, to put on us Martyrs Robes; by that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance both Chaſtning and Covering our ſins; As the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe
<pb facs="tcp:170662:13"/> their Nobles, beating their Clothes, and ſaving their Perſons.</p>
                  <p>There can be no credit loſt by giving glory to God: Did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> loſe any thing by confeſsing that God had found him out, and his Garment, and his Wedg? Hath not <hi>Adonibezek got a Fame of Ingenuity, for acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Art of Juſticing, in that moſt exact way of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſion or Retaliation?</hi> which is ſo frequent in theſe times, though it is not conſiderd. What loſt <hi>Luther</hi> by confeſsing his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall defects as to God, (Though he yeilded not a jot in his Cauſe, as to men?) What Enemy ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided that to him? or this to <hi>the ingenuous learned Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170662:13"/> his humble and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſsion upon laſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in his Coments on the <hi>13.</hi> ver. of the <hi>5.</hi> chapter of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpel: <hi>Ye are the ſalt— if the ſalt have loſt, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Army had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Rome, when he was about that Text, and offered great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe to the Clergy there. Which he Chriſtianly Reſenting, inſerts this paſſage, <hi>Wee Prelates of the Church of Rome,</hi> do at this time finde this truth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified on us, in a ſpeciall Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Being by the juſt judgement of God become a ſpoyle, and a Prey, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; not to Infidells, but to Chriſtians; <hi>becauſe wee,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:14"/> who were choſen to be the Salt of the earth,</hi> Evanuimus, <hi>were become light perſons, and unſavoury,</hi> good for nothing but outward Ceremonies, and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna Bona,</hi> the Revenues Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. <hi>Hence it is, that both We, and this City be trodden under foot this ſixth of May, 1527.</hi> And that Excellent <hi>CHARLS the Fifth</hi> is Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for no one thing more, then for acknowleding the Hand of God upon him, both at that pinch which made him pant out, <hi>Jam me ab omnibus deſertum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo:</hi> And upon a leſſer occaſion then that, namely, when his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks had left him all alone late at night, and he would needs hold
<pb facs="tcp:170662:14"/> the Candle to <hi>SELDIUS,</hi> ſhewing him the way down the ſtairs, and up to God, he ſaid; <hi>Thine eys have ſeen me environed with great Armies; now thou ſeeſt me abandoned of mine ordinary Servants.</hi> I acknowledge this change to come from him with whom is no ſhadow of change, <hi>From the mighty hand of God, and I will by no means withſtand it.</hi> And it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the <hi>Scotiſh Presbyters,</hi> ſenſible of God's hand upon them, are at this time making their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God, by Confeſsion of their ſins reſpectively; God grant that (both we and) they may do it right. Though I ſhall ſtill ſtrive with them about the juſtice of the
<pb facs="tcp:170662:15"/> Firſt Cauſe; yet about the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our perſons will I not ſtrive with them, nor about any other matter, ſave onely who ſhall confeſſe themſelves greater ſinners to God. I have ſilenced <hi>David, Pſal. 51.</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in their <hi>9.</hi> Chapt. and cited onely theſe to confirm my ſelf (and thee, Brother) in this duty of giving Glory to God in this manner, <hi>Et confiteantur Tibi omnes populi:</hi> Even ſo, True and righteous are thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all the world, O Lord God Almighty; yea, mercifull are they, and far below our deſervings.</p>
                  <p>I hope no man will think, though I ſpeak thus, that I give him leave to <hi>conſtrue my words Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170662:15"/> as if there was not an atome, or hair of a good man, or man of God in our Church. There were divers <hi>primitive</hi> (and are at this day, Bleſſed be God, The Lord make them <hi>1000</hi> times more then they are,) <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>heavenly ſouls,</hi> veſſels choſen and fitted for the ſervice of the Sanctuary. I ſhall be bold to <hi>inſtance</hi> in <hi>Three,</hi> who died in peace; few conſidering (ſome did) that they were taken away from the evil to come, leſt their eys ſhould ſee (what their ſpirits foreſaw) what is come on us, on whom the days, not of viſitation only, but of vengeance, even the ends of the world are come.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe was <hi>Thomas Jackſon</hi> D. D. late Preſident of Corpus Chriſti Colledge in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170662:16"/> and ſometimes Vicar of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne;</hi> two places that muſt give account to God for the good they had, or might have had by that Man; as all Scholers muſt for his neglected Works.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was Mr. <hi>Nicholas Ferrer</hi> of little <hi>Gidding</hi> in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington Shire, ſometimes fellow-Commoner and Fellow of Clare-hall in Cambridg.</p>
                  <p>The third was the Author of this book, <hi>Maſter GEORGE HERBERT,</hi> Fellow of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Colledge, Orator of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Cambridge, and Rector of Bemmorton in Wiltſhire. All three Holy in their lives, eminent in their gifts, ſignall Proteſtants
<pb facs="tcp:170662:16"/> for their Religion, painfull in their ſeverall ſtations, pretious in their deaths, and ſweet in their memories.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will give thee a briefe of ſome confrontments common to them all, and then ſome of their, at leaſt this Authors proper excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies apart.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> They all had that inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lot and ſigne of Chriſt and Chriſtians, <hi>Iſa. 8.18. Heb. 2.13. Luke 2.34.</hi> To be ſignes of Contradiction (or ſpoken A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) men wondred at, and rated at by the world. <hi>Doctor Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in two particulars ſuffered much. <hi>1.</hi> He had like to have been ſore ſhent by the Parliament in the year, <hi>1628.</hi> for Tenets in
<pb facs="tcp:170662:17"/> Divinity, I cannot ſay, ſo far dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by him, as by ſome men now they are with great Applauſe. His approach to Unity was very neer. <hi>Grant me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but theſe two things, That God has a true freedom in doing good, and man a true freedome in doing evill;</hi> there needs be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controverſie betwixt the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites in point of Providence and Predeſtination. <hi>Attrib. Ep. Ded. 2.</hi> He had an Adverſary in England who writ a book againſt him, with a Title not ſo kindly as might have been deviſed. It was this; A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Dr. <hi>Jackſons</hi> follies: which he bound as an ornament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, (as <hi>Job</hi> ſays) that is, never anſwered but in the language of the
<pb facs="tcp:170662:17"/> Lamb dumb before the ſhearer, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſufferance. And he had one in Scotland who alſo girded at him, without cauſe or anſwer.</p>
                  <p>And for M. <hi>Ferrar,</hi> he was ſo exerciſed with contradictions, as no man that lived ſo private as he deſired to doe, could poſsibly bee more. I have heard him ſay, valuing (not reſenting his owne) ſufferings in this kind, <hi>That to fry a Faggot, was not more martyrdome then continuall obloquy.</hi> He was torn aſunder as with mad horſes, or cruſhed betwixt the upper and under milſtone of contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; that he was a Papiſt, and that he was a Puritan. What is, if this be not, to be ſawn
<pb facs="tcp:170662:18"/> aſunder as <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſtoned as <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> made a Drum, or Tympani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as other Saints of God were? and after his death when by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction (which he laid upon his friends when he lay on his death-bed) A great company of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Tragedies, Love Hymnes, Heroicall poems, &amp;c. were burnt upon his grave, as utter Enemies to Chriſtian Principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, (that was his brand) ſome poor people ſaid, He was a <hi>Conjurer.</hi>

                  <p>And for our Authour <hi>(The ſweet ſinger of the Temple)</hi> though he was one of the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and accompliſh'd men of his time, I have heard ſober men cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him as a man that did not
<pb facs="tcp:170662:18"/> manage his brave parts to his beſt advantage and preferment, but loſt himſelf <hi>in an humble way;</hi> That was the phraſe, I well remember it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing wherin all Three agreed, was a ſingular ſincerity in Imbracing, and tranſcendent Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in Defending the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I ſpeak it in the preſence of God, I have not read ſo hearty, vigorous a Champion againſt <hi>Rome</hi> (amongſt our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Rank) ſo convincing and demonſtrative as D <hi>Jackſon</hi> is. I bleſſe God for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which he hath given me in the Chriſtian Religion againſt the Atheiſt, Jew, and Socinian, and
<pb facs="tcp:170662:19"/> in the Proteſtant, againſt <hi>Rome.</hi> As alſo, by what I have ſeen in Manuſcript of Mr. <hi>Ferrar's,</hi> and heard by relation of his Travels over the Weſterne parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome; in which, his exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite carriage, his rare parts and abilities of underſtanding and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, his Moralls more perfect then the beſt, did tempt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to tempt him, and marke him for a prize, if they could compaſſe him. And opportunity they had to do this, in a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ſeized on him at Padua, where mighty care was had by Phyſicians and others to recover his bodily health, with deſigne to infect his ſoul. But neither did their phyſick nor poyſon work
<pb facs="tcp:170662:19"/> any change in his Religion, but rather inflamed him with an holy zeale, to revenge their charity, by tranſplanting their waſte and miſplaced zeal, (as they were all three admirable in ſeparating from the vile, what was precious in every ſect or perſon under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) to adorn our Proteſtant Religion, by a right renouncing the world with all it's profits and honours, in a true crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh, with all it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by continued Temperance, Faſting, and Watching unto Prayers. In all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, as he farre out-went the <hi>choiceſt</hi> of their <hi>retired men,</hi> ſo did he far under value theſe deeds, rating them much below ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:170662:20"/> prices as they ſet upon them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this deſigne hee help'd to put out <hi>Leſſius,</hi> and to ſtir up us Miniſters to be painfull in that excellent labour of the Lord, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing, feeding the Lambs of Chriſt:</hi> Hee tranſlated a piece of <hi>Lud. Carbo;</hi> wherein <hi>Carbo</hi> confeſſeth, that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks (<hi>i. e.</hi> Proteſtants) had got much advantage by Catechizing: But the Authority at Cambridge ſuffered not that Egyptian Jewell to be publiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>And he that reads M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT'S</hi> Poems attendingly, ſhall finde not onely the excellencies of Scripture Divinitie, and choice paſſages of the Fathers bound up in Meetre; but the Doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:170662:20"/> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> alſo finely and ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; as in the Poems, <hi>To Saints and Angels</hi> pag. <hi>69. The Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Church</hi> pag. <hi>102. Church Militant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſtood they in aſpect to Rome and her children on the left hand. As for our Brethren that erred on the right hand, (<hi>Doctor Jackſon</hi> ſpeaks for himſelf) and <hi>Mr. F.</hi> though he ever honoured their perſons (that were pious and learned) and alwayes ſpoke of them with much Chriſtian reſpect, yet would hee bewaile their miſtakes, which (like miſts) led them in ſome points back again to thoſe errors of Rome which they had forſaken. To inſtance in one: He that ſayes,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:21"/> preaching in the pulpit is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſalvation; fals into two <hi>Romiſh</hi> errours. <hi>1.</hi> That the Scripture is too dark. <hi>2.</hi> That it is unſufficient to ſave a man. And perhaps a third, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the man of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then they intend him, I am ſure. But the chiefe aime of Maſter <hi>F.</hi> and this Authour, was to win thoſe that diſliked our Liturgy, Catechiſme, &amp;c: by the conſtant, reverent, and holy uſe of them: Which, ſurely had we all imitated, having firſt imprinted the vertue of theſe prayers in our own hearts, and then ſtudied with paſsionate and affectionate celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for voyce, geſture, &amp;c:) as in God's preſence, to imprint them
<pb facs="tcp:170662:21"/> in the mindes of the people, (as this Book teaches,) our prayers had been generally as well beloved as they were ſcorned. And for my part, I am apt to think, That our prayers ſtood ſo long, was a favour by God granted us at the prayers of theſe men, <hi>(who prayed</hi> for <hi>theſe prayers as well as</hi> in <hi>them:)</hi> and that they fell ſo ſoon, was a puniſhment of our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, (and other ſins) who had not taught even thoſe that liked them well, to uſe them aright; but that the good old woman would abſolve, though not ſo loud, yet as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Miniſter himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The bleſſed Three in One</hi> did make theſe three men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one point more. That
<pb facs="tcp:170662:22"/> one ſpirit, which divides to every man gifts as he pleaſes, ſeems to me to have dropt upon theſe three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect veſſels all of them ſome uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or tincture of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. Shall I ſay, I hope, or Fear Mr. <hi>Herberts lines</hi> pag. <hi>190.</hi> ſhould be verified?</p>

                  <p>But conſidering the accuſtomed modeſty of Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of things not certain, I much admire that ſtrange Appendix to his Sermons, (partly delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King) about the Signes of the Times, printed in the year <hi>1637.</hi> touching the great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of wind which fell out upon the <hi>Eve of the fifth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1636.</hi> He was much aſtoniſhed at it, and what appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion he had of it, appeares by theſe words of his: This mighty wind was more then a ſigne of the Time, <hi>Tempus ipſum admonebat, The very time it ſelfe was a Signe, and
<pb facs="tcp:170662:23"/> interprets this Meſſenger's voice better then a Linguiſt, as well as the Prophets (were any now) could do.</hi> Both wind and time teach us that truth often mentioned in theſe Meditations. Thus much the Reader may underſtand, that <hi>though we of this Kingdom were in firm League with all the Nations of the earth, yet it is ſtill in God's power, we may fear in his purpoſe, to plague this Kingdome by his owne immediate hand, by this Meſſenger, or by like Tempeſts, more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly then he hath don at any time, by the Famine, Sword, or Peſtilence, to bury many

                  <p>And what ſhall be thought of that which fell from his Pen in his Epiſtle Dedicatory of his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi> written November <hi>20, 1627,</hi> and Printed <hi>1628,</hi> in theſe words, or more? <hi>If any maintain, That all things were ſo decreed by God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſince could have fallen out otherwiſe then it hath done; That nothing can be amended that is amiſſe: I deſire leave to oppugne his opinion, not onely as an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but as an Ignorance,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:24"/> involving enmity to the ſweet Providence of God; as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of ruine to flouriſhing States and Kingdoms, where it grows common, or comes to full height.</hi>

                  <p>Was this a conjecture of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? or a cenſure of the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call influence, or of the meritorious effect of theſe Tenets? Or rather, a Prediction of an Event? Let the Reader judg.</p>

                  <p>This Authour, <hi>Mr. G. HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT,</hi> was extracted out of a Generous, <hi>Noble,</hi> and Ancient Family: His Father was <hi>RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD
<pb facs="tcp:170662:25"/> HERBERT</hi> of <hi>Blache-hall,</hi> in <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deſcended from the <hi>Great Sir RICHARD HERBERT</hi> in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth's time; and ſo his Relation to the Noble Family of that Name, well known. His Mother was Daughter of Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Newport</hi> of <hi>Arcoll,</hi> who doubtleſſe was a pious daughter, ſhe was ſo good and godly a mother; She had ten children, <hi>Job</hi>'s num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and <hi>Job</hi>'s diſtinction, ſeven ſons; for whoſe education ſhe went and dwelt in the Univerſity, to recompence the loſſe of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n</note> in giving them two Mothers.</p>
                  <p>And this great care of hers, this good ſon of hers ſtudied to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and requite, as is ſeen in
<pb facs="tcp:170662:25"/> thoſe many Latin and Greek Verſes, the Obſequious <hi>Parentalia,</hi> he made and printed in her memory: which though they be good, very good, yet (to ſpeak freely even of this man I ſo much honour) they be dull or dead in compariſon of his <hi>Temple Poems.</hi> And no marvel; To write thoſe, he made his ink with water of <hi>Helicon,</hi> but theſe Inſpirations propheticall were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled from above: In thoſe are weake motions of Nature, in theſe Raptures of Grace. In thoſe he writ Fleſh and Blood: A fraile earthly Woman, though a MOTHER, but in theſe he prayſed his Heavenly FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, the God of Men and Angels, and the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:170662:26"/> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>His Maſter;</hi> For ſo (to quicken himſelf in Duties, and to cut off all depending on man, whoſe breath is in his noſthrils) hee uſed ordinarily to call our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I forget not where I left him: He did thrive ſo well there, that he was firſt choſen fellow of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and afterward Oratour of the Univerſitie. The Memorials of him left in the Orators Book, ſhew how he diſcharged the Place: and himſelf intimates, <hi>Church, pag. 39.</hi> That whereas his Birth and Spirit prompted him to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Atchievements, <hi>The way that takes the Town;</hi> and not to ſit ſimpering over a Book; <hi>God did often melt his ſpirit,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:170662:26"/> entice him with Academick Honor, to be content to wear, and <hi>wrap up himſelfe in a gown,</hi> ſo long, till he durſt not put it off, nor retire to any other calling. However, propably he might, I have heard (as other Orators) have had a Secretary of States place.</p>
                  <p>But the good man like a genuine ſon of <hi>Levi</hi> (I had like to have ſaid <hi>Melchiſedeck)</hi> balked all ſecular wayes, ſaw neither father, nor mother, childe nor Brother, birth nor friends (ſave in Chriſt Jeſus) choſe the Lord for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his ſervice for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And he knew full well what he did when he received Holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as appears by every page
<pb facs="tcp:170662:27"/> in this Book, and by the Poems call'd <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> And by this unparalell'd <hi>vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> which he uſed over his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, which made him (ſayes that modeſt Authour of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> before his Poems, <hi>N. F.</hi> who knew him well) <hi>A Peer to the primitive Saints, and more then a pattern to his own age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides his Parſonage, he had alſo a Prebend in the Church of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> which I think (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lived far from, and ſo could not attend the duty of that place,) he would faine have reſigned to Maſter <hi>Ferrer,</hi> and often earneſtly ſued to him to diſcharge him of it; but Maſter <hi>F.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170662:27"/> wholly refuſed, and diverted or directed his charity (as I take it) to the re-edifying of the ruined Church of <hi>Leighton,</hi> where the corps of the Prebend lay. So that the Church of <hi>England</hi> owes to him (beſides what good may come by this Book, towards the repair of us Church-men in point of morals,) the reparation of a <hi>Church-materiall,</hi> and erection of that coſtly piece (of Moſaick or Solomonick work,) <hi>the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> which flouriſhes and ſtands inviolate, when our other Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences are deſolate, and deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I have ſaid are high; but yet there is one thing which I admire above all the reſt: The right managing of the <hi>Fraternall
<pb facs="tcp:170662:28"/> duty of reproof</hi> is (me thinks) one of the moſt difficult offices of Chriſtian Prudence. O Lord! what is then <hi>the Miniſteriall?</hi> To do it as wee ſhould, is likely to anger a whole world of waſpes, to ſet fire on the earth. This, I have conjectured, was that which made many holy men leave the world, and live in wilderneſſes; which, by the way, was not counted by Ancients, an act of Perfection, but of Cowardiſe and poor ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe: of Flight to ſhade and ſhelter, not of Fight in duſt and blood, and heat of the day. This Authour had not only got the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to do this, but the Art of doing this aright.</p>
                  <p>There was not a man in his
<pb facs="tcp:170662:28"/> way (be he of what Ranke hee would) <hi>that ſpoke awry</hi> (in order to God) <hi>but he wip'd his mouth with a modeſt, grave and Chriſtian reproof:</hi> This was Heroicall; Adequate to that Royall Law, Thou ſhalt in any caſe reprove thy Brother, and not ſuffer ſin upon him. And that he did this, I have heard from true Reporters, and thou mayſt ſee he had learned it himſelfe, elſe he never had taught it us, as hee does in divers paſſages of this Book.</p>
                  <p>His ſingular Dexterity in ſweetning this Art, thou mayſt ſee in the Garb and phraſe of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Like a wiſe Maſter-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he has fet about a forme of
<pb facs="tcp:170662:29"/> Speech, transferred it in a Figure, as if he was all the while learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from another man's mouth or pen, and not teaching any. And whereas we all of us deſerved the ſharpneſſe of Reproofe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, He ſaith, <hi>He does this, and he does that;</hi> whereas, poor men, we did no ſuch thing. This dart of his, thus dipped, pierces the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing (ſome will call it a Paradox) which I learned from Him (and <hi>Mr. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>) in the <hi>Managery</hi> of their moſt cordiall and <hi>Chriſtian Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> That this may be maintained in vigour and height without the Ceremonies of Viſits and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yea, without any Trade of
<pb facs="tcp:170662:29"/> ſecular courteſies, meerly in order to ſpirituall Edification of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love. I know they loved each other moſt entirely, and their very ſouls cleaved together moſt intimately, and drove a large ſtock of Chriſtian Intelligence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether long before their deaths: yet ſaw they not each other in many years, I think, ſcarce ever, but as Members of one Univerſitie, in their whole lives.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more may be learn'd from theſe Two (I may ſay, theſe Three) alſo: Namely, That <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> will keep Unity of ſouls, amidſt great differences of Gifts and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There was variation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in their Indowments:
<pb facs="tcp:170662:30"/> 
                     <hi>Doctor Jackſon</hi> had in his youth (as if he then had underſtood Gods calling) laid his grounds carefully in Arithmetick, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Philology, Geometry, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, Logick, Philoſophy, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientall Languages, Hiſtories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (yea, he had Inſight in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry and Hieroglyphicks,) hee made all theſe ſerve either as Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh under the Foundation, or as drudges and day labourers to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. He was copious and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive in Controverſies of all ſorts. <hi>Maſter Ferrar</hi> was Maſter of the Weſterne Tongues; yet cared not for Criticiſmes and curioſities. He was alſo very modeſt in points of controverſie, and would ſcarce venture to <hi>Opine,</hi> even in the
<pb facs="tcp:170662:30"/> points wherein the world cenſured him poſſeſſed. Our Authour was of a midle Temper betwixt, or a Compound of both theſe; yet having rather more of <hi>Maſter Ferrer</hi> in him: And to what he had of him, he added the Art of Divine Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and other polite learning, which ſo commended him to perſons moſt Eminent in their time, that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Donne</hi> inſcribed to him a paper of Latine verſes in print; and the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> having tranſlated ſome Pſalmes into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh meetre, ſent them with a Dedication prefixed, To his very Good friend, <hi>Maſter GEORGE HERBERT,</hi> thinking that he had kept a true decorum in chuſing one ſo fit for the Argument, in reſpect

                  <p>It would ſwell this Preface too much to ſet down the ſeverall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of our Authour: His <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious expence of Time,</hi> which he even meaſured by the <hi>pulſe,</hi> that <hi>native watch</hi> God has ſet in every of us. His eminent <hi>Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Frugality,</hi> (the two beſt Purveiors for his Liberality and Beneficence,) his private <hi>Faſtings,</hi> his <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the body,</hi> his extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary exerciſes thereof, at the
<pb facs="tcp:170662:32"/> ſight or viſit of a <hi>Charnell Houſe,</hi> where every Bone, before the day, riſes up in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fleſhly luſt and pride: at the <hi>ſtroke of a paſſing bell,</hi> when ancient charity uſed (ſaid he) to run to Church, and aſsiſt the dying Chriſtian with prayers and tears (for ſure that was the ground of that cuſtome;) and at all occaſions he could lay hold of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, which he ſought with the diligence that others ſhun and ſhift them. Beſides his carefull, (not ſcrupulous) obſervation of <hi>appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faſts, Lents,</hi> and <hi>Embers:</hi> The neglect and defect of this laſt, he ſaid, had ſuch influx on the children which the Fathers of the Church did beget at ſuch times,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:32"/> as malignant Stars are ſaid to have over naturall Productions; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch Parents, as be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and Prayers, being like <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaak,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> moſt likely to become Children of the Promiſe, Wraſtlers with God, and fitteſt to wear a linnen <hi>Ephod.</hi> And with this <hi>Faſting</hi> he imp'd his prayers both private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: His private muſt be left to God, who ſaw them in ſecret; his publick were the <hi>Morning and Evening Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Church Liturgie,</hi> which he uſed with conſciencious devotion, not of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, but ſerious Judgement; Knowing, <hi>1.</hi> That the Sophiſm uſed to make people hate them, was a ſolid reaſon to make men
<pb facs="tcp:170662:33"/> of underſtanding love them; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe taken out of the Maſſe Book: Taken out, but as gold from droſſe, the precious from the vile. The wiſe Reformers knew <hi>Rome</hi> would cry <hi>Shiſm, ſchiſm,</hi> and therefore they kept all they could lawfully keep, being loth to give offence; as our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, being loth to offend the <hi>Jews</hi> at the great Reformation, kept divers old Elements, and made them new Sacraments and Services, as their frequent Waſhings he turned into one Baptiſme; ſome ſervice of the Paſſeover into the Lord's Supper. <hi>2.</hi> That <hi>the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and courſeneſſe,</hi> which alſo was objected, was a great commendation. The Lambes poor
<pb facs="tcp:170662:33"/> of the Flock are forty, for one grounded chriſtian: proportionable muſt be the care of the Church to provide milk; that is, plain and eaſie nouriſhment for them: and ſo had our Church done, hoping that ſtronger Chriſtians, as they abounded in Gifts, ſo they had ſuch a ſtore of the Grace of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as for their weak Brethren's ſakes to be content therewith.</p>
                  <p>He thought alſo that a ſet Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was of great uſe in reſpect of thoſe without, whether erring Chriſtians, or unbelieving men. That when we had uſed our beſt arguments againſt their errours or unbeliefe, we might ſhew them a Form wherein we did, and deſired they would ſerve Almighty God
<pb facs="tcp:170662:34"/> with us: That we might be able to ſay, <hi>This is our Church, Here would we land you.</hi> Thus we believe, <hi>ſee the Creed. Thus we pray, baptize, catechiſe, celebrate the Euchariſt, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Bury,</hi> Intreat the ſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, beſides Unity, and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary benefits, he thought grounds ſufficient to bear him out in this practiſe: wherein he ended his life, calling for the Church Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a while before his death, ſaying, <hi>None to them, none to them</hi> at once both commending them, and his ſoul to God in them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his diſſolution, as ſome <hi>Martyrs</hi> did, <hi>Mr. Hullier</hi> by name, Vicar of <hi>Babram,</hi> burnt to death in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:170662:34"/> having the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> in his hand, in ſtead of a Cenſor, and uſing the prayers as incenſe, offered up himſelfe as a whole Burnt Sacrifice to God; with whom the very Book it ſelfe ſuffered Martyrdome, when fallen out of his conſumed hands, it was by the Executioners thrown into the fire and burnt as an Hereticall Book.</p>
                  <p>He was moreover ſo great a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Church-Muſick,</hi> That he uſually called it <hi>Heaven upon earth,</hi> and attended it a few days before his death. But above all, his chief delight was in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> One leafe whereof he profeſſed he would not part with, though he might have the whole
<pb facs="tcp:170662:35"/> world in Exchange. That was <hi>his wiſdome, his comfort, his joy,</hi> out of that he took his Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>LESSE THEN THE LEAST OF ALL GOD'S MERCIES.</hi> In that he found the ſubſtance, Chriſt, and in Chriſt Remiſsion of ſins, yea, in his blood he placed the goodneſſe of his good works. <hi>It is a good Work,</hi> (ſaid he of Building a Church,) <hi>if it be ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This high eſteem of the <hi>Word of life,</hi> as it wrought in himſelfe a wondrous expreſsion of high Reverence, when ever he either read it himſelfe, or heard others read it, ſo it made him <hi>equally wonder, that thoſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſuch extraordinary love
<pb facs="tcp:170662:35"/> to Chriſt Jeſus, as many did,</hi> could poſsibly give ſuch leave and liberty to themſelves as to hear that word that ſhall judge us at the laſt day, <hi>without any the leaſt expreſſion</hi> of that <hi>holy feare</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> which they ought to charge upon their ſouls in private, and in publick, to imprint upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I with my foul hands ſoiled this (and the other) fair piece, and worn out thy patience: yet have I not ſo much as with one daſh of a penſill, offered to deſcribe that perſon of his, which afforded ſo unuſuall a Conteſſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elegancies, and ſet of Rarities to the Beholder; nor ſaid I any thing of his Perſonall Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:36"/> as an <hi>Husband,</hi> to a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>vertuous Lady;</hi> as a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Maſter, &amp;c. yet will I not ſilence his ſpirituall love and care of Servants: Teaching Maſters this duty, To allow their Servants daily time, wherein to pray pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and to enjoyne them to do it: holding this for true generally, <hi>That publick prayer alone to ſuch perſons, is no prayer at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have given thee onely theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of his mind, and thou mayeſt fully ſerve thy ſelfe of this Book, in what vertue of his thy ſoul longeth after. <hi>His</hi> practice it was, and <hi>His Character</hi> it is, <hi>His</hi> as <hi>Authour,</hi> and <hi>His</hi> as <hi>Object:</hi> yet, Lo, the humility of this gracious man! He had ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:170662:36"/> eſteem of this Book, and but very little of his Poems. Though God had magnified him with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts, yet ſaid he, <hi>God has broken into my Study, and taken off my Chariot wheels, I have nothing worthy of God.</hi> And even this lowlineſſe in his own eyes, doth more advance their worth, and his vertues.</p>
                  <p>I have done, when I have beſought the R. Fathers, ſome Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall, Eccleſiaſticall, and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall men, (which Ranks the modeſt Authour meddles not with,) to draw <hi>Idaea's</hi> for their ſeverall Orders reſpectively. (Why ſhould Papiſts (as <hi>Timpius</hi>) be more carefull or painfull in this kind then we?) If it do no other good,
<pb facs="tcp:170662:37"/> yet will it help on in the the way of <hi>Repentance,</hi> by diſcovery of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſtakes or neglects; which is the greateſt, if not the onely Good that can probably be hoped for, out of this Tract: which being writ nigh <hi>twenty years ſince,</hi> will be leſſe ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170662:38"/> Duty and Auctority. For firſt, Man fell from God by diſobedience. Secondly, Chriſt is the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God for the revoking of Man. Thirdly, Chriſt being not to continue on earth, but after hee had fulfilled the work of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to be received up into heaven, he conſtituted Deputies in his place, and theſe are Prieſts.

Of thoſe that live in the Univerſities, ſome live there in office, whoſe rule is that of the Apoſtle; Rom. 12.6. <hi>Having gifts differing, according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith; or miniſtry, let us wait
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170662:39"/> on our miniſtring; or he that teacheth, on teaching,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he that ruleth, let him do it with diligence,</hi> &amp;c. Some in a preparatory way, whoſe aim and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour muſt be not only to get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but to ſubdue and mortifie all luſts and affections: and not to think, that when they have read the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Schoolmen, a Miniſter is made, and the thing done. The greateſt and hardeſt preparation is within: For, <hi>Unto the ungodly, ſaith God, Why doſt thou preach my Laws, and takeſt my Covenant in thy mouth? Pſal.</hi> 50.16. Thoſe that live in Noble Houſes are called Chaplains, whoſe duty and obligation being the ſame to the Houſes they live in, as a Parſons to his Pariſh, in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the one (which is indeed the bent of my Diſcourſe) the other will be manifeſt. Let not Chaplains think themſelves ſo free, as <hi>many of them do,</hi> and becauſe they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Names, think their Office dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170662:39"/> Doubtleſſe they are Parſons of the families they live in, and are entertained to that end, either by an open, or implicite Covenant. Before they are in Orders, they may be received for Companions, or diſcourſers; but after a man is once Miniſter, he cannot agree to come into any houſe, where he ſhall not exerciſe what he is, unleſſe he forſake his plough, and look back. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not to be over-ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and baſe, but to keep up with the Lord and Lady of the houſe, and to preſerve a boldneſs with them and all, even ſo farre as reproofe to their very face, when occaſion cals, but ſeaſonably and diſcreetly. They who do not thus, while they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their earthly Lord, do much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their heavenly; they wrong the Prieſthood, neglect their duty, and ſhall be ſo farre from that which they ſeek with their over-ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cringings, that they ſhall

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding exact in his Life, being holy, juſt, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, temperate, bold, grave in all his wayes. And becauſe the two higheſt points of Life, wherein a Chriſtian is moſt ſeen, are Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Mortification; Patience in regard of afflictions, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of luſts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſtupifying and deading of all the clamarous powers of the foul, therefore he hath throughly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170662:40"/> ſtudied theſe, that he may be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter and commander of himſelf, for all the purpoſes which God hath ordained him. Yet in theſe points he labours moſt in thoſe things which are moſt apt to ſcandalize his Pariſh. And firſt, becauſe Countrey people live hardly, and therefore as feeling their own ſweat, and conſequently knowing the price of mony, are offended much with any, who by hard uſage increaſe their travell, the Countrey Parſon is very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in avoiding all coveteouſneſſe, neither being greedy to get, nor ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly to keep, nor troubled to loſe any worldly wealth; but in all his words and actions ſlighting, and diſeſteeming it, even to a wondring, that the world ſhould ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue wealth, which in the day of wrath hath not one dramme of comfort for us. Secondly becauſe Luxury is a very viſible ſinne, the Parſon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170662:41"/> is very carefull to avoid all the kinds thereof, but eſpecially that of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, becauſe it is the moſt popular vice; into which if he come, <hi>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes himſelf</hi> both to ſhame, and ſin, and by having <hi>fellowſhip, with the unfruitfull works of darkneſſe,</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth himſelf of authority <hi>to reprove them:</hi> For ſins make all equall, whom they finde together; and then they are worſt, who ought to be beſt. Neither is it for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt to haunt Innes, or Tavernes, or Ale-houſes, <hi>to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his perſon and office.</hi> The Parſon doth not ſo, but orders his Life in ſuch a faſhion, that when death takes him, as the Jewes and <hi>Judas</hi> did Chriſt, he may ſay as He did, <hi>I ſate daily with you teaching in the Temple.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe Countrey people (as indeed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men) do much eſteem their word, it being the Life of buying, and ſelling, and dealing in the world;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170662:41"/> therfore the Parſon is very ſtrict in keeping his word, though it be to his own hinderance, as knowing, that if he be not ſo, he wil quickly be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and diſregarded: neither will they beleeve him in the pulpit, whom they cannot truſt in his Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for oaths, and apparell the diſorders thereof are alſo very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. The Parſons yea is yea, and nay nay; and his apparrell plaine, but reverend, and clean, without ſpots, or duſt, or ſmell; the purity of his mind breaking out, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it ſelfe even to his body, cloaths, and habitation.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is full of all knowledg. They ſay, it is an ill Maſon that refuſeth any ſtone: and there is no knowledg, but, in a skilfull hand, ſerves either poſitively as it is, or elſe to illuſtrate ſome other knowledge. He condeſcends even to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of tillage, and paſtorage, and makes great uſe of them in teaching, becauſe people by what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, are beſt led to what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not. But the chief and top of his knowledge conſiſts in the book of books, the ſtorehouſe and magazene of life and comfort, the holy Scriptures. There he ſucks, and lives. In the Scriptures hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170662:42"/> findes four things; Precepts for life, Doctrines for knowledge, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples for illuſtration, and Promiſes for comfort: Theſe he hath dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſeverally. But for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe; the means he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth are firſt, a holy Life, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what his Maſter ſaith, that <hi>if any do Gods will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, John</hi> 7. and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf, that wicked men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever learned, do not know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe they feel them not, and becauſe they are not underſtood but with the ſame Spirit that writ them. The ſecond means is prayer, which if it be neceſſary even in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, how much more in things of another world, where the well is deep, and we have nothing of our ſelves to draw with? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ever begins the reading of the Scripture with ſome ſhort inward ejaculation, as, <hi>Lord, open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wondrous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170662:43"/> things of thy Law.</hi> &amp;c. The third means is a diligent Collation of Scripture with Scripture. For all Truth being conſonant to it ſelf, and all being penn'd by one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, it cannot be, but that an induſtrious, and judicious comparing of place with place muſt be a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar help for the right underſtanding of the Scriptures. To this may be added the conſideration of any text with the coherence thereof, touching what goes before, and what follows after, as alſo the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt. When the Apoſtles would have called down fire from Heaven, they were reproved, as ignorant of what ſpirit they were. For the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired one thing, and the Goſpel ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet as diverſe, not as repugnant: therefore the ſpirit of both is to be conſidered, and weighed. The fourth means are Commenters and fathers, who have handled the places controverted, which the Parſon by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170662:43"/> no means refuſeth. As he doth not ſo ſtudy others, as to neglect the grace of God in himſelf, and what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit teacheth him; ſo doth he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf, that God in all ages hath had his ſervants, to whom he hath revealed his Truth, as well as to him; and that as one Countrey doth not bear all things, that there may be a Commerce; ſo neither hath God opened, or will open all to one, that there may be a traffick in knowledg between the ſervants of God, for the planting both of love, and humility. Wherfore he hath one Comment at leaſt upon every book of Scripture, and ploughing with this, and his own meditations, he enters into the ſecrets of God treaſured in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

For though the world is full of ſuch compoſures, yet every mans own is fitteſt, readyeſt, and moſt ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170662:44"/> houres. This Body he made by way of expounding the Church Catechiſme, to which all divinity may eaſily be reduced. For it being indifferent in it ſelfe to chooſe any Method, that is beſt to be choſen, of which there is likelyeſt to be moſt uſe. Now Catechizing being a work of ſingular, and admirable benefit to the Church of God, and a thing required under Canonicall obedience, the expounding of our Catechiſme muſt needs be the moſt uſefull forme. Yet hath the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, beſides this laborious work, a ſlighter forme of Catechizing, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for country people; according as his audience is, ſo he uſeth one, or other; or ſomtimes both, if his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be intermixed. He greatly eſteemes alſo of caſes of conſcience, wherein he is much verſed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, herein is the greateſt ability of a Parſon to lead his people exactly in the wayes of Truth, ſo that they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170662:45"/> neither decline to the right hand, nor to the left. Neither let any think this a ſlight thing. For every one hath not digeſted, when it is a ſin to take ſomething for mony lent, or when not; when it is a fault to diſcover anothers fault, or when not; <hi>when the affections of the ſoul in deſiring and procuring increaſe of means, or honour, be a ſin of covetouſnes or ambition, and when not; when the appetites of the body in eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſleep, and the pleaſure that comes with ſleep, be ſins of gluttony, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſloath, luſt, and when not,</hi> and ſo in many circumſtances of actions. Now if a ſhepherd know not which graſs will bane, or which not, how is he fit to be a ſhepherd? Wherefore the Parſon hath throughly canvaſſed al the particulars of humane actions, at leaſt all thoſe which he obſerveth are moſt incident to his Pariſh.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon, when he is to read divine ſervices, compoſeth himſelfe to all poſſible reverence; lifting up his heart and hands, and eyes, and uſing all other geſtures which may expreſſe a hearty, and unfeyned devotion. This he doth, firſt, as being truly touched and amazed with the Majeſty of God, before whom he then preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet not as himſelf alone, but as preſenting with himſelf the whole Congregation, whoſe ſins he then beares, and brings with his own to the heavenly altar to be bathed, and waſhed in the ſacred Laver of Chriſts blood. Secondly, as this is the true reaſon of his inward feare,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170662:46"/> ſo he is content to expreſſe this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the utmoſt of his power; that being firſt affected himſelf, hee may affect alſo his people, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no Sermon moves them ſo much to a reverence, which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get againe, when they come to pray, as a devout behaviour in the very act of praying. Accordingly his voyce is humble, his words treatable, and flow; yet not ſo ſlow neither, as to let the fervency of the ſupplicant hang and dy between ſpeaking, but with a grave livelineſſe, between fear and zeal, pauſing yet preſſing, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes his duty. Beſides his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he having often inſtructed his people how to carry themſelves in divine ſervice, exacts of them all poſſible reverence, by no means enduring either talking, or ſleeping, or gazing, or leaning, or halfe-knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or any undutifull behaviour in them, but cauſing them, when they ſit, or ſtand, or kneel, to do all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170662:46"/> in a ſtrait, and ſteady poſture, as attending to what is done in the Church, and every one, man, and child, anſwering aloud both Amen, and all other anſwers, which are on the Clerks and peoples part to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; which anſwers alſo are to be done not in a hudling, or ſlubbe ring faſhion, gaping, or ſcratching the head, or ſpitting even in the midſt of their anſwer, but gently and pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, thinking what they ſay; ſo that while they anſwer, <hi>As it was in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. they meditate as they ſpeak, that God hath ever had his people, that have glorified him as wel as now, and that he ſhall have ſo for ever. And the like in other anſwers. This is that which the Apoſtle cals a reaſonable ſervice, <hi>Rom,</hi> 12. when we ſpeak not as Parrats, without reaſon, or offer up ſuch ſacrifices as they did of old, which was of beaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd of reaſon; but when we uſe our reaſon, and apply our powers to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170662:47"/> ſervice of him, that gives them. If there be any of the gentry or nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pariſh, who ſomtimes make it a piece of ſtate not to come at the beginning of ſervice with their poor neighbours, but at mid-prayers, both to their own loſs, and of theirs alſo who gaze upon them when they come in, and neglect the preſent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, he by no means ſuffers it, but after divers gentle admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they perſevere, he cauſes them to be preſented: or if the poor Church-wardens be affrighted with their greatneſs, notwithſtanding his inſtruction that they ought not to be ſo, but even to let the world ſinke, ſo they do their duty; he preſents them himſelf, only proteſting to them, that not any ill will draws him to it, but the debt and obligation of his calling, being to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Parſon preaching.</head>
                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth conſtantly, the pulpit is his joy and his throne: if he at any time intermit, it is either for want of health, or againſt ſome great Feſtivall, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter celebrate it, or for the variety of the hearers, that he may be heard at his returne more attentively. When he intermits, he is ever very well ſupplyed by ſome able man who treads in his ſteps, and will not throw down what he hath built; whom alſo he intreats to preſs ſome point, that he himſelf hath often urged with no great ſucceſs, that ſo in the mouth of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the truth may be more eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170662:48"/> When he preacheth, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures attention by all poſſible art, both by earneſtneſſe of ſpeech, it being naturall to men to think, that where is much earneſtneſs, there is ſomewhat worth hearing; and by a diligent, and buſy caſt of his eye on his auditors, with letting them know, that he obſerves who marks, and who not; and with particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of his ſpeech now to the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort, then to the elder, now to the poor, and now to the rich. This is for you, and This is for you; for particulars ever touch, and awake more then generalls. Herein alſo he ſerves himſelfe of the judgements of God, as of thoſe of antient times, ſo eſpecially of the late ones; and thoſe moſt, which are neareſt to his Pariſh; for people are very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at ſuch diſcourſes, and think it behoves them to be ſo, when God is ſo neer them, and even over their heads. Sometimes he tells them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170662:48"/> ſtories, and ſayings of others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his text invites him; for them alſo men heed, and remember better then exhortations; which though earneſt, yet often dy with the Sermon, eſpecially with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people; which are thick, and heavy, and hard to raiſe to a poynt of Zeal, and fervency, and need a mountaine of fire to kindle them; but ſtories and ſayings they will well remember. He often tels them, that Sermons are dangerous things, that none goes out of Church as he came in, but either better, or worſe; that none is careleſs before his Judg, and that the word of God ſhal Judge us. By theſe and other means the Parſon procures at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but the character of his Sermon is Holineſs; he is not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or learned, or eloquent, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A Character, that <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> never dream'd of, and therefore he could give no precepts thereof.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170662:49"/> But it is gained firſt, by chooſing texts of Devotion, not Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, moving and raviſhing texts, whereof the Scriptures are full. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by dipping, and ſeaſoning all our words and ſentences in our hearts, before they come into our mouths, truly affecting, and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expreſsing all that we ſay; ſo that the auditors may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that every word is hart-deep. Thridly, by turning often, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many Apoſtrophes to God, as, Oh Lord bleſſe my people, and teach them this point; or, Oh my Maſter, on whoſe errand I come, let me hold my peace, and doe thou ſpeak thy ſelfe; for thou art Love, and when thou teacheſt, all are Scholers. Some ſuch irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations ſcatteringly in the Sermon, carry great holineſs in them. The Prophets are admirable in this. So Iſa. 64. <hi>Oh that thou would'ſt rent the Heavens, that thou wouldſt come down,</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170662:49"/> &amp;c. And <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chapt. 10. after he had complained of the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> turnes to God ſuddenly, <hi>Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by frequent wiſhes of the peoples good, and joying therein, though he himſelf were with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> even ſacrificed upon the ſervice of their faith. For there is no greater ſign of holineſſe, then the procuring, and rejoycing in anothers good. And herein St <hi>Paul</hi> excelled in all his Epiſtles. How did he put the <hi>Romans</hi> in all his prayers? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. And ceaſed not to give thanks for the <hi>Epheſians, Eph.</hi> 1.16. And for the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 1.4. And for the <hi>Philippians</hi> made requeſt with joy <hi>ch.</hi> 1.4. And is in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them whither to live, or dy; be with them, or Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. which, ſetting aſide his care of his Flock, were a madneſſe to doubt of. What an admirable Epiſtle is the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170662:50"/> ſecond to the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> how full of affections? he joyes, and he is ſorry, he grieves, and he gloryes, never was there ſuch care of a flock expreſſed, ſave in the great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the fold, who firſt ſhed teares over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards blood. Therefore this care may be learn'd there, and then woven into Sermons, which will make them appear exceeding reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and holy. Laſtly, by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten urging of the preſence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, by theſe, or ſuch like ſpeeches. Oh let us all take heed what we do, God ſees us, he ſees whether I ſpeak as I ought, or you hear as you ought, he ſees hearts, as we ſee faces: he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; for if we be here, hee muſt be here, ſince we are here by him, and without him could not be here. Then turning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Majeſty, And he is a great God, and terrible, as great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170662:50"/> in mercy, ſo great in judgement: There are but two devouring ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fire, and water, he hath both in him; His voyce is as the ſound of many waters, <hi>Revelations</hi> 1. And he himſelfe is a conſuming fire, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. Such diſcourſes ſhew very Holy. The Parſons Method in handling of a text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two parts; firſt, a plain and evident declaration of the meaning of the text; and ſecondly, ſome choyce Obſervations drawn out of the whole text, as it lyes entire, and unbroken in the Scripture it ſelf. This he thinks naturall, and ſweet, and grave. Whereas the other way of crumbling a text into ſmall parts, as, the Perſon ſpeaking, or ſpoken to, the ſubject, and object, and the like, hath neither in it ſweetneſſe, nor gravity, nor variety, ſince the words apart are not Scripture, but a dictionary, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170662:51"/> alike in all the Scripture. The Parſon exceeds not an hour in preaching, becauſe all ages have thought that a competency, and he that profits not in that time, will leſſe afterwards, the ſame affection which made him not profit before, making him then weary, and ſo he grows from not reliſhing, to loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                     <p>THe Country Parſon, as ſoon as he awakes on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, preſently falls to work, and ſeems to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo as a Market-man is, when the Market day comes, or a ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, when cuſtomers uſe to come in. His thoughts are full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170662:51"/> the beſt of the day, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to his beſt gaines. To this end, beſides his ordinary prayers, he makes a peculiar one for a bleſſing on the exerciſes of the day, That nothing befall him unworthy of that Majeſty before which he is to preſent himſelf, but that all may be done with reverence to his glory, and with edification to his flock, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeching his Maſter, that how or whenever he puniſh him, it be not in his Miniſtry: then he turnes to requeſt for his people, that the Lord would be pleaſed to ſanctifie them all, that they may come with holy hearts, and awfull mindes into the Congregation, and that the good God would pardon all thoſe, who come with leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared hearts then they ought. This done, he ſets himſelf to the Conſideration of the duties of the day, and if there be any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary addition to the cuſtomary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170662:52"/> either from the time of the year, or from the State, or from God by a child born, or dead, or any other accident, he contrives how and in what manner to induce it to the beſt advantage. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when the hour calls, with his family attending him, he goes to Church, at his firſt entrance <hi>humbly adoring, and worſhipping the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble majeſty, and preſence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God,</hi> and bleſſing the people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly, or to himſelfe. Then having read divine Service twice fully, and preached in the morning, and catechized in the afternoone, he thinks he hath in ſome meaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to poor, and fraile man, diſcharged the publick duties of the Congregation. The reſt of the day he ſpends either in reconciling neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that are at variance, or in viſiting the ſick, or in exhortations to ſome of his flock by themſelves, whom his Sermons cannot, or doe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170662:52"/> not reach. And every one is more awaked, when we come, and ſay, Thou art the man. This way he findes exceeding uſefull, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and theſe exhortations he cals his privy purſe, even as Princes have theirs, beſides ther publick disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At night he thinks it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit time, both ſutable to the joy of the day, and without hinderance to publick duties, either to entertaine ſome of his neighbours, or to be entertained of them, where he takes occaſion to diſcourſe <hi>of ſuch things as are both profitable, and pleaſant, and to raiſe up their mindes to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Gods good bleſsing to our Church, and State; that order is kept in the one, and peace in the other, without diſturbance, or interruption of publick dvinie offices.</hi> As he opened the day with prayer, ſo he cloſeth it, humbly beſeeching the Almighty to pardon and accept our poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and to improve them, that

                     <p>THe Country Parſon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that virginity is a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtate then Matrimony, and that the Miniſtry requires the beſt and higheſt things, is rather unmarryed, then marryed. But yet as the temper of his body may be, or as the temper of his Pariſh may be, where he may have occaſion to converſe with women, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuſpicious men, <hi>and other like circumſtances conſidered,</hi> he is rather married then unmarried. Let him communicate the thing often
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170662:53"/> by prayer unto God, and as his grace ſhall direct him, ſo let him proceed. If he be unmarried, and keepe houſe, he hath not a woman in his houſe, but findes opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of having his meat dreſs'd and other ſervices done by men-ſervants at home, and his linnen waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. If he be unmarryed, and ſojourne, he never talkes with any woman alone, but in the audience of others, and that ſeldom, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a ſerious manner, never jeſtingly or ſportfully. <hi>He is very circumſpect in all companyes, both of his behaviour, ſpeech, and very looks, knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be both ſuſpected, and envyed. If he ſtand ſteadfaſt in his heart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no neceſsity, but hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own will, and hath ſo decreed in his heart, that he will keep himſelf a virgin, he ſpends his dayes in faſting and prayer, and bleſſeth God for the gift of continency, knowing that it can no way be preſerved, but only by thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170662:54"/> means, by which at firſt it was obtained. He therefore thinkes it not enough for him to obſerve the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting dayes of the Church, and the dayly prayers enjoyned him by auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he obſerveth out of humble conformity, and obedience; but adds to them, out of choyce and devotion; ſome other dayes for faſting, and hours for prayers; and by theſe hee keeps his body tame, ſerviceable, and healthfull; and his ſoul fervent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, young, and luſty as an eagle. He often readeth the Lives of the Primi; tive Monks, Hermits, and virgins, and wondreth not ſo much at their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſuffering, and cheerfull dying under perſecuting Emperours, (though that indeed be very admirable) as at their daily temperance, abſtinence, watchings, and constant prayers, and mortifications in the times of peace and proſperity. To put on the profound humility, and the exact temperance of our Lord Jeſus, with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170662:54"/> other exemplary vertues of that ſort, and to keep them on in the ſunſhine, and noone of proſperity, he findeth to be as neceſſary, and as difficult at leaſt, as to be cloathed with perfect patience, and Chriſtian fortitude in the cold midnight ſtormes of perſecution and adverſity. He keepeth his watch and ward, night and day againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar temptations of his ſtate of Life, which are principally theſe two, Spirituall pride, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of heart: againſt theſe ghoſtly enemies he girdeth up his loynes, keepes the imagination from roving, puts on the whole Armour of God, and by the vertue of the ſhield of faith, he is not afraid of the peſtilence that walketh in darkeneſſe, [carnall impurity,] nor of the ſickneſſe that destroyeth at noone day, [Ghostly pride and ſelf-conceite.] Other temptations he hath, which, like mortall enemies, may ſometimes diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et him likewiſe; for the humane ſoule being bounded, and kept in in her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170662:55"/> faculty, will runne out more or leſſe in her intellectuall. Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concupiſence is ſuch an active thing, by reaſon of continuall inward, or outward temptations, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempting, or doing one miſchief or other. Ambition, or untimely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of promotion to an higher ſtate, or place, under colour of accommodation, or neceſſary proviſion, is a common tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to men of any eminency, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being ſingle men. Curioſity in prying into high ſpeculative and unprofitable queſtions, is another great ſtumbling block to the holineſſe of Scholers. Theſe and many other ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high places doth the Parſon fear, or experiment, or both; and that much more being ſingle, then if he were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed; for then commonly the ſtream of temptations is turned another way, into Covetouſneſſe, Love of pleaſure, or eaſe, or the like. If the Parſon be unmarryed, and means to continue ſo, he doth at leaſt, as much as hath been
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170662:55"/> ſaid.</hi> If he be marryed, the choyce of his wife was made rather by his eare, then by his eye; his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not his affection found out a fit wife for him, whoſe humble, and liberall diſpoſition he preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beauty, riches, or honour. <hi>He knew that (the good inſtrument of God to bring women to heaven) a wiſe and loving husband could out of humility, produce any ſpeciall grace of faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, meekneſſe, love, obedience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and out of liberality, make her fruitfull in all good works.</hi> As hee is juſt in all things, ſo is he to his wife alſo, counting nothing ſo much his owne, as that he may be unjuſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Therefore he gives her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both afore her ſevants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and halfe at leaſt of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the houſe, reſerving ſo much of the affaires, as ſerve for a diverſion for him; yet never ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over the raines, but that he ſometimes looks how things go, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170662:56"/> an account, but not by the way of an account. And this muſt bee done the oftner, or the ſeldomer, according as hee is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of his Wifes diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a curing, and healing of all wounds and ſores with her owne hands; which skill either ſhe brought with her, or he takes care ſhe ſhall learn it of ſome religious neighbour. Thirdly, a providing for her family in ſuch ſort, as that neither they want a competent ſuſtentation, nor her husband be brought in debt.

However, he reſolves with himſelf never to omit any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good deed of charity, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of providing a ſtock for his children; but aſſures himſelfe, that mony thus lent to God, is placed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170662:57"/> for his childrens advantage, then if it were given to the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi> Good deeds, and good breeding, are his two great ſtocks for his children; if God give any thing above thoſe, and not ſpent in them, he bleſſeth God, and lays it out as he ſees cauſe. His ſervants are all religious, and were it not his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have them ſo, it were his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for none are ſo well ſerved, as by religious ſervants, both becauſe they do beſt, and becauſe what they do, is bleſſed, and proſpers. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he teacheth them, that three things make a compleate ſervant, Truth, and Diligence, and Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or Cleanlineſſe. Thoſe that can read, are allowed times for it, and thoſe that cannot, are taught; for all in his houſe are either teachers or learners, or both, ſo that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is a Schoole of Religion, and they all account, that to teach the ignorant is the greateſt almes.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170662:58"/> Even the wals are not idle, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is written, or painted there, which may excite the reader to a thought of piety; eſpecially the 101 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is expreſſed in a fayre table, as being the rule of a family. And when they go abroad, his wife among her neighbours is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of good diſcourſes, his children among children, his ſervants among other ſervants; ſo that as in the houſe of thoſe that are skill'd in Muſick, all are Muſicians; ſo in the houſe of a Preacher, all are preachers. He ſuffers not a ly or equivocation by any means in his houſe, but counts it the art, and ſecret of governing to preſerve a directineſſe, and open plainneſſe in all things; ſo that all his houſe knowes, that there is no help for a fault done, but confeſſion. He <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or his <hi>Wife,</hi> takes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Sermons, and how every one profits, comparing this yeer with the laſt: and beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170662:58"/> prayers of the family, he ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requires of all to pray by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before they ſleep at night, and ſtir out in the morning, and knows what prayers they ſay, and till they have learned them, makes them kneel by him; eſteeming that this private praying is a more voluntary act in them, then when they are called to others prayers, and that, which when they leave the family, they carry with them. He keeps his ſervants between love, and fear, according as hee findes them; but generally he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes it thus, To his Children he ſhewes more love then terrour, to his ſervants more terrour then love; but an old good ſervant boards a child. The furniture of his houſe is very plain, but clean, whole, and ſweet, as ſweet as his garden can make; for he hath no mony for ſuch things, charity being his only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, which deſerves coſt when he can ſpare it. His fare is plain, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170662:59"/> common, but wholſome, what hee hath, is little, but very good; it conſiſteth moſt of mutton, beefe, and veal, if he addes any thing for a great day, or a ſtranger, his garden or orchard ſupplyes it, or his barne, and back-ſide: he goes no further for any entertainment, leſt he goe into the world, eſteeming it abſurd, that he ſhould exceed, who teacheth others temperance. But thoſe which his home produceth, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not, as coming cheap, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ariſing from the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things, which otherwiſe would be loſt. Wherein he admires and imitates the wonderfull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and thrift of the great houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the world: for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two things, which as they are, are unuſeful to man, the one for ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as crums, and ſcattered corn, and the like; the other for the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as waſh, and durt, and things thereinto fallen; God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170662:59"/> Creatures for both; for the firſt, Poultry; for the ſecond, ſwine. Theſe ſave man the labour, and doing that which either he could not do, or was not fit for him to do, by taking both ſorts of food into them, do as it were dreſſe and prepare both for man in themſelves, by growing them ſelves fit for his table. The Parſon in his houſe obſerves faſting dayes; and particularly, as Sunday is his day of joy, ſo Friday his day of Humiliation, which he celebrates not only with abſtinence of diet, but alſo of company, recreation, and all outward contentments; and beſides, with confeſſion of ſins, and all acts of Mortification. Now faſting dayes containe a treble obligation; firſt, of eating leſſe that day, then on other dayes; ſecondly, of eating no pleaſing, or over-nouriſhing things, as the Iſraelites did eate ſowre herbs: Thirdly, of eating no fleſh, which is but the determination of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170662:60"/> ſecond rule by Authority to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The two former obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are much more eſſentiall to a true faſt, then the third and laſt; and faſting dayes were fully performed by keeping of the two former, had not Authority interpoſed: ſo that to eat little, and that unpleaſant, is the naturall rule of faſting, although it be fleſh. For ſince faſting in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture language is an afflicting of our ſouls, if a peece of dry fleſh at my table be more unpleaſant to me, then ſome fiſh there, certainly to eat the fleſh, and not the fiſh, is to keep the faſting day naturally. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the prohibiting of fleſh came from hot Countreys, where both fleſh alone, and much more with wine, is apt to nouriſh more then in cold regions, and where fleſh may be much better ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and with more ſafety then elſewhere, where both the people and the drink being cold and fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170662:60"/> the eating of fleſh is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote to both. For it is certaine, that a weak ſtomack being prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with fleſh, ſhall much better brooke and bear a daught of beer, then if it had taken before either fiſh, or rootes, or ſuch things; which will diſcover it ſelfe by ſpitting, and rheume, or flegme. To conclude, the Parſon, if he be in full health, keeps the three obligations, eating fiſh, or roots, and that for quantity little, for quality unpleaſant. If his body be weak and obſtructed, as moſt Students are, he cannot keep the laſt obligation, nor ſuffer others in his houſe that are ſo, to keep it; but only the two former, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in diſeaſes of exinanition (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions) muſt be broken: For meat was made for man, not man for meat. To all this may be added, not for emboldening the unruly, but for the comfort of the weak, that not onely ſickneſſe breaks theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170662:61"/> of faſting, but ſicklineſſe alſo. For it is as unnatural to do any thing, that leads me to a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to which I am inclined, as not to get out of that ſickneſſe, when I am in it, by any diet. One thing is evident, that an Engliſh body, and a Students body, are two great obſtructed veſſels, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is food, and not phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which doth leſſe obſtruct, then fleſh moderately taken; as being immoderately taken, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding obſtructive. And obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the cauſe of moſt diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon owing a debt of Charity to the poor, and of Courteſie to his other pariſhioners, he ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, that he keeps his money for the poor, and his table for thoſe that are above Alms. Not but that the poor are welcome alſo to his table, whom he ſometimes purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes home with him, ſetting them cloſe by him, and carving for them, both for his own humility, and their comfort, who are much cheered with ſuch friendlineſes. But ſince both is to be done, the better ſort invited, and meaner relieved, he chooſeth rather to give the poor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170662:62"/> money, which they can better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to their own advantage, and ſutably to their needs, and then ſo much given in meat at dinner. Having then invited ſome of his Pariſh, hee taketh his times to do the like to the reſt; ſo that in the compaſſe of the year, hee hath them all with him, becauſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people are very obſervant of ſuch things, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but being not invited, they are hated. Which perſwaſion the Parſon by all means avoyds, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that where there are ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, there is no room for his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to enter. Yet doth hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſt invite thoſe, whom hee ſees take beſt courſes, that ſo both they may be encouraged to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and others ſpurred to do well, that they may enjoy the like cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. For though he deſire, that all ſhould live well, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, not for any reward of his,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170662:62"/> but for vertues ſake; yet that will not be ſo: and therefore as God, although we ſhould love him onely for his own ſake, yet out of his infinite pity hath ſet forth heaven for a reward to draw men to Piety, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if at leaſt ſo, they will become good. So the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Parſon, who is a diligent obſerver, and tracker of Gods wayes, ſets up as many encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to goodneſſe as he can, both in honour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and fame; that he may, if not the beſt way, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way, make his Pariſh good.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Parſon's Charity.</head>
                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is full of Charity; it is his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant element. For many and wonderfull things are ſpoken of thee, thou great Vertue. To Charity is given the covering of ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. and the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Romans</hi> 13.10. The life of faith, <hi>James</hi> 2.26. The bleſſings of this life, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 22.9. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 41.2. And the reward of the next, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35. In brief, it is the body of Religion, <hi>John</hi> 13.35. And the top of Chriſtian vertues, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 13. Wherefore all his works relliſh of Charity. When he riſeth in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170662:63"/> morning, he bethinketh himſelfe what good deeds he can do that day, and preſently doth them; counting that day loſt, wherein he hath not exerciſed his Charity. He firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders his own Pariſh, and takes care, that there be not a begger, or idle perſon in his Pariſh, but that all bee in a competent way of getting their living. This he affects either by bounty, or perſwaſion, or by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, making uſe of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtatute, which bindes all Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes to maintaine their own. If his Pariſh be rich, he exacts this of them; if poor, and he able, he eaſeth them therin. But he gives no ſet pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to any; for this in time will loſe the name and effect of Charity with the poor people, though not with God: for then they will reckon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as on a debt; and if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, though juſtly, they will murmur, and repine as much, as he that is diſſeized of his own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170662:64"/> But the Parſon having a double aime, and making a hook of his Charity, cauſeth them ſtill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him; and ſo by continuall, and freſh bounties, unexpected to them, but reſolved to himſelf, hee wins them to praiſe God more, to live more religiouſly, and to take more paines in their vocation, as not knowing when they ſhal be relieved; which otherwiſe they would reckon upon, and turn to idleneſſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this generall proviſion, he hath other times of opening his hand; as at great Feſtivals, and Communions; not ſuffering any that day that hee receives, to want a good meal ſuting to the joy of the occaſion. But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, at hard times, and dearths, he even parts his Living, and life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, giving ſome corn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſelling other at under rates; and when his own ſtock ſerves not, working thoſe that are able to the ſame charity, ſtill preſſing it in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170662:64"/> pulpit, and out of the pulpit, and never leaving them, till he obtaine his deſire. Yet in all his Charity, he diſtinguiſheth, giving them moſt, who live beſt, and take moſt paines, and are moſt charged: So is his charity in effect a Sermon. After the conſideration of his own Pariſh, he inlargeth himſelf, if he be able, to the neighbour-hood; for that alſo is ſome kind of obligation; ſo doth he alſo to thoſe at his door, whom God puts in his way, and makes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But theſe he helps not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome teſtimony, except the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the miſery bring teſtimony with it. For though theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo may be falſifyed, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the Law allows theſe in caſe they be true, but allows by no means to give without teſtimony, as he obeys Authority in the one, ſo that being once ſatisfied, he allows his Charity ſome blindneſſe in the other; eſpecially, ſince of the two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170662:65"/> commands, we are more injoyned to be charitable, then wiſe. But evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miſeries have a naturall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and exemption from all law. When-ever hee gives any thing, and ſees them labour in thanking of him, he exacts of them to let him alone, and ſay rather, God be praiſed, God be glorified; that ſo the thanks may go the right way, and thither onely, where they are onely due. So doth hee alſo before giving make them ſay their Prayers firſt, or the Creed, and ten Commandments, and as he finds them perfect, rewards them the more. For other givings are lay, and ſecular, but this is to give like a Prieſt.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon hath a ſpeciall care of his Church, that all things there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and befitting his Name by which it is called. Therefore firſt he takes order, that all things be in good repair; as walls plaiſtered, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows glazed, floore paved, ſeats whole, firm, and uniform, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that the Pulpit, and Deck, and Communion Table, and Font be as they ought, for thoſe great duties that are performed in them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Church be ſwept, and kept cleane without duſt, or Cobwebs, and at great feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls ſtrawed, and ſtuck with boughs, and perſumed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170662:66"/> Thirdly, That there be fit, and proper texts of Scripture eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where painted, and that all the painting be grave, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, not with light colours, or fooliſh anticks. Fourthly, That all the books appointed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be there, and thoſe not torne, or fouled, but whole; and clean, and well bound; and that there be a fitting, and ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion Cloth
<q>of fine linnen, with an handſome, and ſeemly Carpet of good and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stuffe, or Cloth, and all kept ſweet and clean, in a ſtrong and decent cheſt, with a Chalice, and Cover, and a Stoop, or Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and a Baſon for Almes and offerings; beſides which, he hath a Poor-mans Box conveniently ſeated, to receive the charity of well minded people, and to lay up treaſure for the ſick and needy.</q> And all this he doth,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170662:66"/> not as out of neceſſity, or as putting a holineſs in the things, but as deſiring to keep the middle way between ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and ſlovenlineſſe, and as following the Apoſtles two great and admirable Rules in things of this nature: The firſt whereof is, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order:</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Let all things be done to edification,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. For theſe two rules comprize and include the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object of our duty, God, and our neighbour; the firſt being for the honour of God; the ſecond for the benefit of our neighbor. So that they excellently ſcore out the way, and fully, and exactly contain, even in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and indifferent things, what courſe is to be taken; and put them to great ſhame, who deny the Scripture to be perfect.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon upon the afternoons in the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, takes occaſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to viſite in perſon, now one quarter of his Pariſh, now another. For there he ſhall find his flock moſt naturally as they are, wallowing in the midſt of their affairs: whereas on Sundays it is eaſie for them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to order, which they put on as their holy-day cloathes, and come to Church in frame, but commonly the next day put off both. When he comes to any houſe, firſt he bleſſeth it, and then as hee finds the perſons of the houſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, ſo he formes his diſcourſe. Thoſe that he findes religiouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170662:67"/> hee both commends them much, and furthers them when hee is gone, in their imployment; as if hee findes them reading, hee furniſheth them with good books; if curing poor people, hee ſupplies them with Receipts, and inſtructs them further in that skill, ſhewing them how acceptable ſuch works are to God, and wiſhing them ever to do the Cures with their own hands, and not to put them over to ſervants. Thoſe that he finds buſie in the works of their calling, he commendeth them alſo: for it is a good and juſt thing for every one to do their own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But then he admoniſheth them of two things; firſt, that they dive not too deep into worldly affairs, plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves over head and eares into carking, and caring; but that they ſo labour, as neither to labour anxiouſly, nor diſtruſtfully, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely. Then they labour anxiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, when they overdo it, to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170662:68"/> loſs of their quiet, and health: then diſtruſtfully, when they doubt Gods providence, thinking that their own labour is the cauſe of their thriving, as if it were in their own hands to thrive, or not to thrixe. <q>Then they labour profanely, when they ſet themſelves to work like brute beaſts, never raiſing their thoughts to God, nor ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their labour with daily prayer; when on the Lords day they do unneceſſary ſervile work, or in time of divine ſervice on other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days, except in the caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty, and in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Seed-time, and Harveſt.</q> Secondly, he adviſeth them ſo to labour for wealth and maintenance, as that they make not that the end of their labour, but that they may have wherewithall to ſerve God the better, and to do good deeds. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe diſcourſes, if they be poor and needy, whom he thus finds la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170662:68"/> he gives them ſomewhat; and opens not only his mouth, but his purſe to their relief, that ſo they go on more cheerfully in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and himſelf be ever the more welcome to them. Thoſe that the Parſon findes idle, or ill imployed, he chides not at firſt, for that were neither civill, nor profitable; but always in the cloſe, before he departs from them: yet in this he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth; for if he be a plaine country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he reproves him plainly; for they are not ſenſible of fineneſſe: if they be of higher quality, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are quick, and ſenſible, and very tender of reproof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lays his diſcourſe ſo, that he comes to the point very leaſurely, and oftentimes, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did, in the perſon of another, making them to reprove themſelves. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, one way or other, he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, that he may keep himſelf pure, and not be intangled
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170662:69"/> in others ſinnes. Neither in this doth he forbear, though there be company by: for as when the offence is particular, and againſt mee, I am to follow our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours rule, and to take my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſide, and reprove him; ſo when the offence is publicke, and againſt God, I am then to follow the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.20. and to <hi>rebuke open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> that which is done openly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe occaſionall diſcourſes, the Parſon queſtions what order is kept in the houſe, as about prayers morning, and evening on their knees, reading of Scripture, catechizing, ſinging of Pſalms at their work, and on holy days; who can read, who not; and ſometimes he hears the children read himſelfe, and bleſſeth, encouraging alſo the ſervants to learn to read, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have them taught on holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes by his ſervants. If the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170662:69"/> Parſon were aſhamed of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing in theſe things, hee were not fit to be a Parſon: but he holds the Rule, that Nothing is little in Gods ſervice: If it once have the honour of that Name, it grows great inſtantly. Wherfore neither diſdaineth he to enter into the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cottage, though he even creep into it, and though it ſmell never ſo lothſomly. For both God is there alſo, and thoſe for whom God dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſo much the rather doth he ſo, as his acceſſe to the poor is more comfortable, then to the rich; and in regard of himſelfe, it is more humiliation. Theſe are the Parſons generall aims in his Circuit; but with theſe he mingles other diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for converſation ſake, and to make his higher purpoſes ſlip the more eaſily.</p>

To this end he hath throughly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted all the points of conſolation, as having continuall uſe of them, ſuch as are from Gods generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence extended even to lillyes; from his particular, to his Church; from his promiſes, from the examples of all Saints, that ever were; from Chriſt himſelf, perfecting our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption no other way, then by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170662:70"/> ſorrow; from the Benefit of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which ſoftens, and works the ſtubborn heart of man; from the certainty both of deliverance, and reward, if we faint not; from the miſerable compariſon of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of griefs here with the weight of joyes hereafter. <q>Beſides this, in his viſiting the ſick, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afflicted, he followeth the Churches counſell, namely, in perſwading them to particular confeſſion, labouring to make them underſtand the great good uſe of this antient and pious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and how neceſſary it is in ſome caſes: he alſo urgeth them to do ſome pious charitable works, as a neceſſary evidence and fruit of their faith, at that time eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: the participation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, how comfortable, and Soveraigne a Medicine it is to all ſinſick ſouls, what ſtrength, and joy, and peace it adminiſters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170662:71"/> againſt all temptations, even to death it ſelfe, he plainly, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally intimateth to the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or ſick perſon, that ſo the hunger and thirſt after it may come rather from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then from his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is not only a father to his flock, but alſo profeſſeth himſelfe throughly of the opinion, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it about with him as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he had begot his whole Pariſh. And of this he makes great uſe. For by this means, when any ſinns, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him not as an officer, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170662:71"/> pityes him as a Father: and even in thoſe wrongs which either in tithing, or otherwiſe are done to his owne perſon, hee conſiders the offender as a child, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives, ſo hee may have any ſigne of amendment; ſo alſo when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many admonitions, any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be refractory, yet hee gives him not over, but is long before hee proceede to diſinherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or perhaps never goes ſo far; knowing, that ſome are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the eleventh houre, and therefore hee ſtill expects, and waits, leaſt hee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Gods houre of coming; which as hee cannot, touching the laſt day, ſo neither touching the intermediate days of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                     <p>THe countrey Parſon, when a juſt occaſion calleth him out of his Pariſh (which he diligently, and ſtrictly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, his Pariſh being all his joy, and thought) leaveth not his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry behind him; but is himſelfe where ever he is. Therefore thoſe he meets on the way he bleſſeth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly, and with thoſe he overtakes or that overtake him, hee begins good diſcourſes, ſuch as may edify, interpoſing ſometimes ſome ſhort, and honeſt refreſhments, which may make his other diſcourſes more welcome, and leſſe tedious. And when he comes to his Inn, he refuſeth not to joyne, that he may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170662:72"/> enlarge the glory of God to the company he is in, by a due bleſſing of God for their ſafe arrival, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace at meat, and at going to bed by giving the Hoſt notice, that he will have prayers in the hall, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing him to informe his gueſts thereof, that if any be willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, they may reſort thither. The like he doth in the morning, uſing pleaſantly the outlandiſh proverb, that <hi>Prayers and Provender never hinder journey.</hi> When he comes to any other houſe, where <hi>his kindred, or other relations give him any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Family,</hi> if hee be to ſtay for a time, hee conſiders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the ſtate thereof to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that in two points: Firſt, what diſorders there are either in Apparell, or Diet, or too open a Buttery, or reading vain books, or ſwearing, or breeding up children to no Calling, but in idleneſs, or the like. Secondly, what means of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170662:73"/> Piety, whether daily prayers be uſed, Grace, reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and other good books, how <hi>Sundayes, holy-days, and faſting days</hi> are kept. And accordingly, as he finds any defect in theſe, hee firſt conſiders with himſelfe, what kind of remedy fits the temper of the houſe beſt, and then hee faithfully, and boldly applyeth it; yet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, and diſcreetly, by taking aſide the Lord, or Lady; or <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Miſtres</hi> of the houſe, and ſhewing them cleerly, that they reſpect them moſt, who wiſh them beſt, and that not a deſire to meddle with others affairs, but the earneſtneſſe to do all the good he can, moves him to ſay thus and thus.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon, where ever he is, keeps Gods watch; that is, there is nothing ſpoken, or done in the Company where he is, but comes under his Teſt and cenſure: If it be well ſpoken, or done, he takes occaſion to commend, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it; if ill, he preſently lays hold of it, leaſt the poyſon ſteal into ſome young and unwary ſpirits, and poſſeſſe them even before they themſelves heed it. But this he doth diſcretely, with mollifying, and ſuppling words; This was not ſo well ſaid, as it might have been forborn; We cannot allow this: or elſe if the thing will admit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; Your meaning is not thus, but thus; or, So farr indeed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170662:74"/> what you ſay is true, and well ſaid; but this will not ſtand. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led keeping Gods watch, when the baits which the enemy lays in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, are diſcovered and avoyded: This is to be on Gods ſide, and be true to his party. Beſides, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in company any diſcourſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ill, either by the wickedneſs or quarrelſomneſſe thereof, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevents it judiciouſly, or breaks it off ſeaſonably by ſome diverſion. Wherein a pleaſantneſs of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of great uſe, men being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſell the intereſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of their diſcourſes for no price ſooner, then that of mirth; whither the nature of man, loving refreſhment, gladly betakes it ſelfe, even to the loſſe of honour.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere nnd upright in all his relations. And firſt, he is juſt to his Countrey; as when he is ſet at an armour, or horſe, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes them not to ſerve the turne, nor provides ſlight, and unuſefull, but ſuch as are every way fitting to do his Countrey true and laudable ſervice, when occaſion requires. To do otherwiſe, is deceit; and therefore not for him, who is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and true in all his wayes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervant of him, in whom there was no guile. Likewiſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Countrey-duty, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what is the end of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then he ſuits things faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully according to that end. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he carryes himſelf very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170662:75"/> as to all the Fathers of the Church, ſo eſpecially to his Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, honouring him both in word, and behaviour, and reſorting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in any difficulty, either in his ſtudies or in his Pariſh. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Viſitations, and being there, makes due uſe of them, as of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy councels, for the benefit of the Dioceſe. And therefore before he comes, having obſerved ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Miniſtry, he then either in Sermon, if he preach, or at ſome other time of the day, propounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Brethren what were fitting to be done. Thirdly, he keeps good Correſpondence with all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Paſtours round about him, performing for them any Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all office, which is not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his own Pariſh. Likewiſe he welcomes to his houſe any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, how poor or mean ſoever, with as joyfull a countenance, as if he were to entertain ſome great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170662:75"/> Lord. Fourthly, he fulfills the duty, and debt of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to all the Pariſhes which are neer him. For the Apoſtles rule <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. being admirable, and large, that <hi>we ſhould do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things are honeſt, or juſt, or pure, or lovely, or of good report, if there be any vertue, or any praiſe.</hi> And Neighbourhood being ever reputed, even among the Heathen, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to do good, rather then to thoſe that are further, where things are otherwiſe equall, therefore he ſatisfies this duty alſo. Eſpecially, if God have ſent any calamity either by fire, or famine, to any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Pariſh, then he expects no Briefe; but taking his Pariſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the next Sunday,</hi> or <hi>holy-day,</hi> and expoſing to them the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of humane affairs, none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe turne may be next, and then when he hath affrighted them with this, expoſing the obligation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170662:76"/> of Charity, and Neighbour-hood, he firſt gives himſelf liberally, and then incites them to give; making together a ſumme either to be ſent, or, which were more comfortable, all together chooſing ſome fitt day to carry it themſelves, and cheere the Afflicted. So, if any neighbouring village be overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with poore, and his owne leſſe charged, hee findes ſome way of releeving it, and reducing the Manna, and bread of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſome equality, repreſenting to his people, that the Bleſſing of God to them ought to make them the more charitable, and not the leſſe, leſt he caſt their neighbours poverty on them alſo.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is in Gods ſtead to his Pariſh, and diſchargeth God what he can of his promiſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing done either wel or ill, whereof he is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, or puniſher. If he chance to finde any reading in anothers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he provides him one of his own. If he finde another giving a poor man a penny, he gives him a teſter for it, if the giver be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; or if he be of a condition above ſuch gifts, he ſends him a good book, or eaſeth him in his Tithes, telling him when he hath forgotten it, this I do, becauſe at ſuch, and ſuch a time you were charitable. This is in ſome ſort a diſcharging of God; as concerning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170662:77"/> this life, who hath promiſed, that Godlineſſe ſhall be gainfull: but in the other God is his own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate paymaſter, rewarding all good deeds to their full proportion. <q>The Parſons puniſhing of ſin and vice, is rather by withdrawing his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and courteſie from the parties offending, or by private, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reproof, as the caſe requires, then by cauſing them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, or otherwiſe complained of. And yet as the malice of the perſon, or hainouſneſs of the crime may be, he is carefull to ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment inflicted, and with truly godly zeal, without hatred to the perſon, hungreth and thirſteth after righteous puniſhment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe. Thus both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding vertue, and in puniſhing vice, the Parſon endeavoureth to be in Gods ſtead, knowing that Countrey people are drawne, or led by ſenſe, more then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170662:77"/> by faith, by preſent rewards, or puniſhments, more then by future.</q>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The Parſon Catechizing.</head>
                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon values Catechizing highly: for there being three points of his duty, the one, to infuſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of ſalvation in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his Flock; the other, to multiply, and build up this knowledge to a ſpirituall Temple; the third, to inflame this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to preſſe, and drive it to practice, turning it to reformation of life, by pithy and lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations; Catechizing is the firſt point, and but by Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, the other cannot be attained.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170662:78"/> Beſides, whereas in Sermons there is a kinde of ſtate, in Catechizing there is an humbleneſſe very ſutable to Chriſtian regeneration, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delights him as by way of exerciſe upon himſelf, and by way of preaching to himſelf, for the advancing of his own mortification, For in preaching to others, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets not himſelf, but is firſt a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to himſelf, and then to others; growing with the growth of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. He uſeth, and preferreth the ordinary Church-Catechiſm, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for obedience to Authority, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for uniformity ſake, that the ſame common truths may be every where profeſſed, eſpecially ſince many remove from Pariſh to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, who like Chriſtian Souldiers are to give the word, and to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Congregation by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick anſwers. He exacts of all the Doctrine of the Catechiſme; of the younger ſort, the very words;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170662:78"/> of the elder, the ſubſtance. Thoſe he Catechizeth publickly, theſe privately, giving age honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. He requires all to be preſent at Catechizing: firſt, for the authority of the work; Secondly, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Maſters, as they hear the anſwers prove, may when they come home, either commend or reprove, either reward or puniſh. Thirdly, that thoſe of the elder ſort, who are not well grounded, may then by an honourable way take occaſion to be better inſtructed. Fourthly, that thoſe who are well grown in the knowledg of Religion, may examine their grounds, renew their vowes, and by occaſion of both, inlarge their meditations. When once all have learned the words of the Catechiſme, he thinks it the moſt uſefull way that a Paſtor can take, to go over the ſame, but in other words: for many ſay the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170662:79"/> by rote, as parrats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever piercing into the ſenſe, of it. In this courſe the order of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme would be kept, but the reſt varyed: as thus, in the Creed: How came this world to be as it is? Was it made, or came it by chance? Who made it? Did you ſee God make it? Then are there ſome things to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that are not ſeen? Is this the nature of beliefe? Is not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity full of ſuch things, as are not to be ſeen, but beleeved? You ſaid, God made the world; Who is God? And ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, requiring anſwers to all theſe, and helping and cheriſhing the Anſwerer, by making the Queſtion very plaine with compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and making much even of a word of truth from him. This order being uſed to one, would be a little varyed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is an admirable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170662:79"/> way of teaching, wherein the Catechized will at length finde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and by which the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizer, if he once get the skill of it, will draw out of ignorant and ſilly ſouls, even the dark and deep points of Religion, <hi>Socrates</hi> did thus in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, who held that the ſeeds of all truths lay in every body, and accordingly by queſtions well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered he found Philoſophy in ſilly Tradeſ-men. That poſition will not hold in Chriſtianity, becauſe it contains things above nature: but after that the Catechiſme is once learn'd, that which nature is towards Philoſophy, the Catechiſm is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Divinity. To this purpoſe, ſome dialogues in <hi>Plato</hi> were worth the reading, where the ſingular dexterity of <hi>Socrates</hi> in this kind may be obſerved, and imitated. Yet the skill conſiſts but in theſe three points: Firſt, an aim and mark of the whole diſcourſe, whither to drive
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170662:80"/> the Anſwerer, which the Queſtioniſt muſt have in his mind before any queſtion be propounded, upon which and to which the queſtions are to be chained. Secondly, a moſt plain and eaſie framing the queſtion, even containing in vertue the anſwer alſo, eſpecially to the more ignorant. Thirdly, when the anſwerer ſticks, an illuſtrating the thing by ſomething elſe, which he knows, making what hee knows to ſerve him in that which he knows not: As, when the Parſon once demanded after other queſtions about mans miſery; ſince man is ſo miſerable, what is to be done? And the anſwerer could not tell; He asked him again, what he would do, if he were in a ditch? This familiar illuſtration made the anſwer ſo plaine, that he was even aſhamed of his ignorance; for he could not but ſay, he would haſt out of it as faſt he could. Then he proceeded to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170662:80"/> ask, whether he could get out of the ditch alone, or whether he needed a helper, and who was that helper. This is the skill, and doubtleſſe the Holy Scripture intends thus much, when it condeſcends to the naming of a plough, a hatchet, a buſhell, leaven, boyes piping and dancing; ſhewing that things of ordinary uſe are not only to ſerve in the way of drudgery, but to be waſhed, and cleanſed, and ſerve for lights even of Heavenly Truths. This is the Practice which the Parſon ſo much commends to all his fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; the ſecret of whoſe good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that at Sermons, and Prayers, men may ſleep or wander; but when one is asked a queſtion, he muſt diſcover what he is. This practice exceeds even Sermons in teaching: but there being two things in Sermons, the one Informing, the other Inflaming; as Sermons come ſhort of queſtions in the one, ſo they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170662:81"/> farre exceed them in the other. For queſtions cannot inflame or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, that muſt be done by a ſet, and laboured, and continued ſpeech.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon being to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is at a ſtand with himſelf, how or what behaviour to aſſume for ſo holy things. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially at Communion times he is in a great confuſion, as being not only to receive God, but to break, and adminiſter him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther findes he any iſſue in this, but to throw himſelf down at the throne of grace, ſaying, Lord, thou knoweſt what thou didſt, when
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170662:81"/> thou appointedſt it to be done thus; therefore doe thou ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill what thou didſt appoint; for thou art not only the feaſt, but the way to it. At Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in white, he requires the preſence of all, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth not willingly, but on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, or great dayes. Hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no vaine or idle names, but ſuch as are uſuall and accuſtomed. Hee ſays that prayer with great devotion, where God is thanked for calling us to the knowledg of his grace, Baptiſme being a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that the world hath not the like. He willingly and cheerfully croſſeth the child, and thinketh the Ceremony not onely innocent, but reverend. He inſtructeth the God-fathers, and God-mothers, that it is no complementall or light thing to ſuſtain that place, but a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and no leſs burden, as being done both in the preſence of God,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170662:82"/> and his Saints, and by way of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for a Chriſtian ſoul. He adviſeth all to call to minde their Baptiſm often; for if wiſe men have thought it the beſt way of preſerving a ſtate to reduce it to its principles by which it grew great; certainly, it is the ſafeſt courſe for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alſo to meditate on their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme often (being the firſt ſtep into their great and glorious calling) and upon what termes, and with what vowes they were Baptized. At the times of the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he firſt takes order with the Church-Wardens, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be of the beſt, not cheape, or courſe, much leſſe ill-taſted, or unwholſome. Secondly, hee conſiders and looks into the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or carleſneſs of his flock, and accordingly applies himſelfe with Catechizings, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhortations, not on the Sunday of the Communion only (for then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170662:82"/> it is too late;) but the Sunday, or Sundayes before the Communion, or on the Eves of all thoſe dayes. If there be any, who having not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yet, is to enter into this great work, he takes the more pains with them, that hee may lay the foundation of future Bleſſings. The time of every ones firſt receiving is not ſo much by yeers, as by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: particularly, the rule may be this: When any one can diſtinguiſh the Sacramentall from common bread, knowing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the difference, hee ought to receive, of what age ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Children and youths are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually deferred too long, under pretence of devotion to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is for want of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their underſtandings being ripe enough for ill things, and why not then for better? But Parents, and Maſters ſhould make haſt in this, as to a great purchaſe for their children,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170662:83"/> and ſervants; which while they deferr, both ſides ſuffer; the one, in wanting many excitings of grace; the other, in being worſe ſerved and obeyed. The ſaying of the Catechiſm is neceſſary, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; becauſe to anſwer in form may ſtill admit ignorance: but the Queſtions muſt be propounded looſely and wildely, and then the Anſwerer will diſcover what hee is. Thirdly, For the manner of receiving, as the Parſon uſeth all reverence himſelf, ſo he adminiſters to none but to the reverent. The Feaſt indeed requires ſitting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Feaſt; but man's unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſſe asks kneeling. Hee that comes to the Sacrament, hath the confidence of a Gueſt, and hee that kneels, confeſſeth himſelf an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy one, and therefore differs from other Feaſters: but hee that ſits, or lies, puts up to an Apoſtle: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſneſſe in a feaſt of Charity is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170662:83"/> more ſcandall then any poſture. Fourthly, touching the frequency of the Communion, the Parſon ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates it, if not duly once a month, yet at leaſt five or ſix times in the year; as, at Eaſter, Chriſtmaſſe, Whitſuntide, afore and after Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and the beginning of Lent. And this hee doth, not onely for the benefit of the work, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the diſcharge of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, who being to preſent all that receive not thrice a year; if there be but three Communions, neither can all the people ſo order their affairs as to receive juſt at thoſe times, nor the Church-Wardens ſo well take notice who receive thrice, and who not.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be all to his Pariſh, and not onely a Paſtour, but a Lawyer alſo, and a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. Therefore hee endures not that any of his Flock ſhould go to Law; but in any Controverſie, that they ſhould reſort to him as their Judge. To this end, he hath gotten to himſelf ſome inſight in things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily incident and controverted, by experience, and by reading ſome initiatory treatiſes in the Law, with <hi>Daltons</hi> Juſtice of Peace, and the Abridgements of the Statutes, as alſo by diſcourſe with men of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, whom he hath ever ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ask, when he meets with them; holding that rule, that to put men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170662:84"/> to diſcourſe of that, wherin they are moſt eminent, is the moſt gainfull way of Converſation. Yet when ever any controverſie is brought to him, he never decides it alone, but ſends for three or four of the ableſt of the Pariſh to hear the cauſe with him, whom he makes to deliver their opinion firſt; out of which he gathers, in caſe he be ignorant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what to hold; and ſo the thing paſſeth with more authority, and leſſe envy, In Judging, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that, which is altogether right; ſo that if the pooreſt man of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh detain but a pin unjuſtly from the richeſt, he abſolutely reſtores it as a Judge; but when he hath ſo done, then he aſſumes the Parſon, and exhorts to Charity. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, there may happen ſomtimes ſome caſes, wherein he chooſeth to permit his Pariſhioners rather to make uſe of the Law, then himſelf: As in caſes of an obſcure and dark
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170662:85"/> nature, not eaſily determinable by Lawyers themſelves; or in caſes of high conſequence, as eſtabltſhing of inheritances: or Laſtly, when the perſons in difference are of a contentious diſpoſition, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gained, but that they ſtill fall from all compromiſes that have been made. But then he ſhews them how to go to Law, even as Brethren, and not as enemies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther avoyding therfore one anothers company, much leſſe defaming one another. Now as the Parſon is in Law, ſo is he in ſickneſſe alſo: if there be any of his flock ſick, hee is their Phyſician, or at leaſt his Wife, of whom in ſtead of the qualities of the world, he asks no other, but to have the skill of healing a wound, or helping the ſick. But if neither himſelfe, nor his wife have the skil, and his means ſerve, hee keepes ſome young practicioner in his houſe for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170662:85"/> of his Pariſh, whom yet he ever exhorts not to exceed his bounds, but in tickle caſes to call in help. If all fail, then he keeps good correſpondence with ſome neighbour Phiſician, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines him for the Cure of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Yet is it eaſie for any Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to attaine to ſuch a meaſure of Phiſick, as may be of much uſe to him both for himſelf, and others. This is done by ſeeing one Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, reading one Book of Phiſick, having one Herball by him. And let <hi>Fernelius</hi> be the Phiſick Authour, for he writes briefly, neatly, and judiciouſly; eſpecially let his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Phiſick be diligently peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as being the practicall part, and of moſt uſe. Now both the reading of him, and the knowing of herbs may be done at ſuch times, as they may be an help, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to more divine ſtudies, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſerving Grace both incomfort
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170662:86"/> of diverſion, and the benefit of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication when need requires; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by way of illuſtration, even as our Saviour made plants and ſeeds to teach the people: for he was the true houſeholder, who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of his treaſure things new and old; the old things of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the new of Grace; and maketh the one ſerve the other. And I conceive, our Saviour did this for three reaſons: firſt, that by familiar things hee might make his Doctrine ſlip the more eaſily into the hearts even of the meaneſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that labouring people (whom he chiefly conſidered) might have every where monuments of of his Doctrine, remembring in gardens, his muſtard-ſeed, and lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes; in the field, his ſeed-corn, and tares; and ſo not be drowned altogether in the works of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but ſometimes lift up their minds to better things, even in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170662:86"/> midſt of their pains. Thirdly, that he might ſet a Copy for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In the knowledge of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wherein the manifold wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is wonderfully to be ſeen, one thing would be carefully obſerved; which is, to know what herbs may be uſed in ſtead of drugs of the ſame nature, and to make the garden the ſhop: For home-bred medicines are both more eaſie for the Parſons purſe, and more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar for all mens bodyes. So, where the Apothecary uſeth either for looſing, Rubarb, or for binding, Bolearmena, the Parſon uſeth da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask or white Roſes for the one, and plantaine, ſhepherds purſe, knot-graſſe for the other, and that with better ſucceſſe. As for ſpices, he doth not onely prefer home-bred things before them, but condemns them for vanities, and ſo ſhuts them out of his family, eſteeming that there is no ſpice comparable, for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170662:87"/> herbs, to roſemary, time, ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, mints; and for ſeeds, to Fennell, and Carroway ſeeds. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ſalves, his wife ſeeks not the city, but preferrs her garden and fields before all outlandiſh gums. And ſurely hyſſope, valerian, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, adders tongue, yerrow, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot, and Saint <hi>Johns</hi> wort made into a ſalve; And Elder, camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, mallowes, comphrey and ſmallage made into a Poultis, have done great and rare cures. In cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any, the Parſon and his Family uſe to premiſe prayers, for this is to cure like a Parſon, and this raiſeth the action from the Shop, to the Church. But though the Parſon ſets forward all Charitable deeds, yet he looks not in this point of Curing beyond his own Pariſh, except the perſon bee ſo poor, that he is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Phiſician: for as hee is Charitable, ſo he is juſt alſo. Now
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170662:87"/> it is a juſtice and debt to the Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth he lives in, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on others Profeſſions, but to live on his own. And juſtice is the ground of Charity.</p>

                        </gap> that it may effectually pierce their hearts, and convert them. The ſecond means is a very loving, and ſweet uſage of them, both in going
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170662:88"/> to, and ſending for them often, and in finding out Courteſies to place on them; as in their tithes, or otherwiſe. The third means is the obſervation what is the main foundation, and pillar of their cauſe, wherein they rely; as if he be a Papiſt, the Church is the hinge he turnes on; if a Sciſmatick, ſcandall. Wherefore the Parſon hath diligently examined theſe two with himſelfe, as what the Church is, how it began, how it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether it be a rule to it ſelfe, whether it hath a rule, whether ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a rule, it ought not to be guided by it; whether any rule in the world be obſcure, and how then ſhould the beſt be ſo, at leaſt in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall things, the obſcurity in ſome points being the exerciſe of the Church, the light in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being the guide; The Church needing both an evidence, and an exerciſe. So for Scandall: what
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170662:88"/> ſcandall is, when given or taken; whether, there being two precepts, one of obeying Authority, the other of not giving ſcandall, that ought not to be preferred, eſpecially ſince in diſobeying there is ſcandall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: whether things once indifferent, being made by the precept of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority more then indifferent, it be in our power to omit or refuſe them. Theſe and the like points hee hath accurately digeſted, having ever beſides two great helps and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull perſwaders on his ſide; the one, a ſtrict religious life; the other an humble, and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch of truth; being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in arguing, and voyd of all contentiouſneſſe: which are two great lights able to dazle the eyes of the miſ-led, while they conſider, that God cannot be wanting to them in Doctrine, to whom he is ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Life.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon at ſpare times from action, ſtanding on a hill, and conſidering his Flock, diſcovers two ſorts of vices, and two ſorts of vicious perſons. There are ſome vices, whoſe natures are alwayes cleer, and evident, as Adultery, Murder, Hatred, Lying, &amp;c.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170662:90"/> There are other vices, whoſe natures, at leaſt in the beginning, are dark and obſcure: as Covetouſneſſe, and Gluttony. So likewiſe there are ſome perſons, who abſtain not even from known ſins; there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who when they know a ſin evidently, they commit it not. It is true indeed, they are long a knowing it, being partiall to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and witty to others who ſhall reprove them from it. A man may be both Covetous, and Intemperate, and yet hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons againſt both, and himſelfe condemn both in good earneſt: and the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe vices being not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcuſſed, or known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, the beginnings of them are not eaſily obſervabled: and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of them are not obſerved, becauſe of the ſuddain paſſing from that which was juſt now lawfull, to that which is preſently unlawfull, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170662:90"/> in one continued action. So a man dining, eats at firſt lawfully; but proceeding on, comes to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, even before he is aware; not knowing the bounds of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor when his eating begins to be unlawfull. So a man ſtoring up mony for his neceſſary proviſions, both in preſent for his family, and in future for his children, hardly perceives when his ſtoring becomes unlawfull: yet is there a period for his ſtoring, and a point, or center, when his ſtoring, which was even now good, paſſeth from good to bad. Wherefore the Parſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true to his buſineſſe, hath exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted the definitions of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and vices; eſpecially canva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe, whoſe natures are moſt ſtealing, and beginnings uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Particularly, concerning theſe two vices, not becauſe they are all that are of this dark, and creeping diſpoſition, but for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170662:91"/> ſake, and becauſe they are moſt common, he thus thinks: firſt, for covetouſnes, he lays this ground, Whoſoever when a juſt occaſion cals, either ſpends not at all, or not in ſome proportion to Gods bleſſing upon him, is covetous. The reaſon of the ground is manifeſt, becauſe wealth is given to that end to ſupply our occaſions. Now, if I do not give every thing its end, I abuſe the Creature, I am falſe to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which ſhould guide me, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſupreme Judg, in perverting that order which he hath ſet both to things, and to reaſon. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, of the ground would be infinite; but in brief, a poor man is an occaſion, my countrey is an occaſion my friend is an occaſion, my Table is an occaſion, my appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is an occaſion: if in all theſe, and thoſe more which concerne me, I either do nothing, or pinch, and ſcrape, and ſqueeze blood unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170662:91"/> to the ſtation wherein God hath placed me, I am Covetous. More particularly, and to give one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for all, if God have given me ſervants, and I either provide too little for them, or that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome, being ſometimes baned meat, ſometimes too ſalt, and ſo not competent nouriſhment, I am Covetous. I bring this example, becauſe men uſually think, that ſervants for their mony are as other things that they buy, even as a piece of wood, which they may cut, or hack, or throw into the fire, and ſo they pay them their wages, all is well. Nay, to deſcend yet more particularly, if a man hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to buy a ſpade, and yet hee chuſeth rather to uſe his neighbours, and wear out that, he is covetous. Nevertheleſs, few bring covetouſneſs thus low, or conſider it ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, which yet ought to be done, ſince there is a Juſtice in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170662:92"/> leaſt things, and for the leaſt there ſhall be a judgment Countrey. peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are full of theſe petty injuſtices, being cunning to make uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpare themſelves: And Scholers ought to be diligent in the obſervation of theſe, and driving of their generall Schoole rules ever to the ſmalleſt actions of Life; which while they dwell in their bookes, they will never finde; but being ſeated in the Countrey, and doing their duty faithfully, they will ſoon diſcover: eſpecially if they carry their eyes ever open, and fix them on their charge, and not on their preferment. Secondly, for Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, The Parſon lays this ground, He that either for quantity eats more then his health or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will bear, or for quality is licorous after danties, is a glutton; as he that eats more then his eſtate will bear, is a Prodigall; and hee that eats offenſively to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170662:92"/> either in his order, or length of eating, is ſcandalous and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable. Theſe three rules general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend the faults of eating, and the truth of them needs no proofe: ſo that men muſt eat neither to the diſturbance of their health, nor of their affairs, (which being overburdened, or ſtudying dainties too mucht; hey cannot wel diſpatch) nor of their eſtate, nor of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. One act in theſe things is bad, but it is the cuſtome and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that names a glutton. Many think they are at more liberty then they are, as if they were Maſters of their health, and ſo they will ſtand to the pain, all is well. But to eat to ones hurt, comprehends, beſides the hurt, an act againſt reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is unnaturall to hurt ones ſelf; and this they are not maſters of. Yet of hurtfull things, I am more bound to abſtain from thoſe, which by mine own experience I have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170662:93"/> found hurtfull, then from thoſe which by a Common tradition, and vulgar knowledge are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſo. That which is ſaid of hurtfull meats, extends to hurtfull drinks alſo. As for the quantity, touching our imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, none muſt eat ſo as to diſable themſelves from a fit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging either of Divine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or duties of their calling. So that if after dinner they are not fit (or un-weeldy) either to pray, or work, they are gluttons. Not that all muſt preſently work after dinner; (For they rather muſt not work, eſpecially Students, and thoſe that are weakly,) but that they muſt riſe ſo, as that it is not meate or drinke that hinders them from working. To guide them in this, there are three rules: firſt, the cuſtome, and knowledg of their own body, and what it can well diſgeſt: The ſecond,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170662:93"/> the feeling of themſelves in time of eating, which becauſe it is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; (for one thinks in eating, that he can eat more, then afterwards he finds true:) The third is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with what appetite they ſit down. This laſt rule joyned with the firſt, never fails. For knowing what one uſually can well diſgeſt, and feeling when I go to meat in what diſpoſition I am, either hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or not, according as I feele my ſelf, either I take my wonted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or diminiſh of it. Yet Phiſicians bid thoſe that would live in health, not keep an uniform diet, but to feed variouſly, now more, now leſſe: And <hi>Gerſon,</hi> a ſpirituall man, wiſheth all to incline rather to too much, then to too little; his reaſon is, becauſe diſeaſes of exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition are more dangerous, then diſeaſes of repletion. But the Parſon diſtinguiſheth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his double aime, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170662:94"/> of Abſtinence a morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Mortification a divine. When he deals with any that is heavy, and carnall; he gives him thoſe freer rules: but when he meets with a refined, and heavenly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he carryes them higher, even ſomtimes to a forgetting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, knowing that there is one, who when they forget, remembers for them; As when the people hungred and thirſted after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Doctrine, and tarryed ſo long at it, that they would have fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had they returned empty, He ſuffered it not; but rather made food miraculouſly, then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo good deſires to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he ſomtimes refreſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as knowing that nature will not bear everlaſting droopings, and that pleaſantneſſe of diſpoſition is a great key to do good; not onely becauſe all men ſhun the company of perpetuall ſeverity, but alſo for that when they are in company, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſeaſoned with pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon knows well, that both for the generall ignominy which is caſt upon the profeſſion, and much more for thoſe rules, which out of his choyſeſt judgment hee hath reſolved to obſerve, and which are deſcribed in this Book, he muſt be deſpiſed; becauſe this hath been the portion of God his Maſter, and of Gods Saints his Brethren, and this is foretold, that it ſhall be ſo ſtill, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til things be no more. Nevertheleſſe,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170662:95"/> according to the Apoſtles rule, he endeavours that none ſhall deſpiſe him; eſpecially in his own Pariſh he ſuffers it not to his utmoſt power; for that, where contempt is, there is no room for inſtruction.

Secondly, by a courteous carriage, &amp; winning behaviour: he that wil be reſpected, muſt reſpect; doing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but receiving none; at leaſt of thoſe, who are apt to deſpiſe: for this argues a height and eminency of mind, which is not eaſily deſpiſed, except it degenerate to pride. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a bold and impartial reproof, even of the beſt in the Pariſh, when occaſion requires: for this may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hatred in thoſe that are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but never contempt either in them, or others. Laſtly, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhall proceed ſo far as to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing puniſhable by law, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170662:96"/> is apt to do, if it be not thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <q>the Parſon having a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both to the perſon, and to the cauſe, referreth the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the examination, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe which are in Authority; that ſo the ſentence lighting upon one, the example may reach to all.</q> But if the Contempt be not puniſhable by Law, or being ſo, the Parſon think it in his deſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either unfit, or booteleſſe to contend, then when any deſpiſes him, he takes it either in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, ſaying nothing at all; or elſe in a ſlighting way, ſhewing that reproaches touch him no more, then a ſtone thrown againſt heaven, where he is, and lives; or in a ſad way, greived at his own, and others ſins, which continually breake Gods Laws, and diſhonour him with thoſe mouths, which he continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fils, and feeds: or elſe in a doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way, ſaying to the contemner,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170662:96"/> Alas, why do you thus? you hurt your ſelfe, not me; he that throws a ſtone at another, hits himſelfe; and ſo between gentle reaſoning, and pitying, he overcomes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: or laſtly, in a Triumphant way, being glad, and joyfull, that hee is made conformable to his Maſter; and being in the world as he was, hath this undoubted pledge of his ſalvation. Theſe are the five ſhields, wherewith the Godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the darts of the wicked; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving anger, and retorting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to the children of the world, whom anothers ill maſtereth, and leadeth captive without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even in reſiſtance, to the ſame deſtruction. For while they reſiſt the perſon that reviles, they reſiſt not the evill which takes hold of them, and is farr the worſe enemy.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon doth often, both publickly, and privately inſtruct his Church-Wardens, what a great Charge lyes upon them, and that indeed the whole order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Pariſh is put into their hands. If himſelfe reforme any thing, it is out of the overflowing of his Conſcienee, whereas they are to do it by Command, and by Oath. Neither hath the place its dignity from the Eccleſiaſticall Laws only, ſince even by the Common Statute-Law they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a kinde of Corporation, as being perſons enabled by that Name
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170662:97"/> to take moveable goods, or chattels, and to ſue, and to be ſued at the Law concerning ſuch goods for the uſe and profit of their Pariſh: and by the ſame Law they are to levy penalties for negligence in reſorting to church, or for diſorderly carriage in time of divine ſervice. Wherefore the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffers not the place to be vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or debaſed, by being caſt on the lower ranke of people; but invites and urges the beſt unto it, ſhewing that they do not looſe, or go leſſe, but gaine by it; it being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honor of this world, to do God and his choſen ſervice; or as <hi>David</hi> ſays, to be even a door-keeper in the houſe of God. Now the Canons being the Church-wardens rule, the Parſon adviſeth them to read, or hear them read often, as alſo the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Articles, which are grounded upon the Canons, that ſo they may know their duty, and keep their oath the better; in which regard, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170662:98"/> the great Conſequence of their place, and more of their oath, he wiſheth them by no means to ſpare any, though never ſo great; but if after gentle, and neighbourly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions they ſtill perſiſt in ill, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them; yea though they be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or otherwiſe ingaged to the delinquent: for their obligation to God, and their own ſoul, is above any temporall tye.

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great aptneſſe Countrey people have to think that all things come by a kind
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170662:98"/> of naturall courſe; and that if they ſow and ſoyle their grounds, they muſt have corn; if they keep and fodder well their cattel, they muſt have milk, and Calves; labours to reduce them to ſee Gods hand in all things, and to beleeve, that things are not ſet in ſuch an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order, but that God often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it according as he ſees fit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for reward or puniſhment. To this end he repreſents to his flock, that God hath and exerciſeth a threefold power in every thing which concernes man. The firſt is a ſuſtaining power; the ſecond a governing power; the third a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power. By his ſuſtaining power he preſerves and actuates eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in his being; ſo that corne doth not grow by any other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then by that which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſupplyes, as the corn needs it; without which ſupply the corne would inſtantly dry up, as a river
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170662:99"/> would if the fountain were ſtopped. And it is obſervable, that if anything could preſume of an inevitable courſe, and conſtancy in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, certainly it ſhould be either the ſun in heaven, or the fire on earth, by reaſon of their fierce, ſtong, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent natures: yet when God pleaſed, the ſun ſtood ſtil, the fire burned not. By Gods governing power he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and orders the references of things one to the other, ſo that though the corn do grow, and be preſerved in that act by his ſuſtaining power, yet if he ſuite not other things to the growth, as ſeaſons, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other accidents by his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power, the faireſt harveſts come to nothing. And it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that God delights to have men feel, and acknowledg, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his power, and therefore he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten overturnes things, when they are thought paſt danger; that is his time of interpoſing: As when a Merchant
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170662:99"/> hath a ſhip come home after many a ſtorme, which it hath eſcaped, he deſtroyes it ſometimes in the very Haven; or if the goods be houſed, a fire hath broken forth, and ſuddenly conſumed them. Now this he doth, that men ſhould perpetuate, and not break off their acts of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, how faire ſoever the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities preſent themſelves. So that if a farmer ſhould depend upon God all the yeer, and being ready to put hand to ſickle, ſhall then ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and think all cock-ſure; then God ſends ſuch weather, as lays the corn, and deſtroys it: or if he depend on God further, even till he imbarn his corn, and then think all ſure; God ſends a fire, and conſumes all that he hath: For that he ought not to break off, but to continue his dependance on God, not onely before the corne is inned, but after alſo; and indeed, to depend, and fear conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. The third power is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170662:100"/> ſpirituall, by which God turnes all outward bleſſings to inward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. So that if a Farmer hath both a faire harveſt, and that alſo well inned, and imbarned, and continuing ſafe there; yet if God give him not the Grace to uſe, and utter this well, all his advantages are to his loſſe. Better were his corne burnt, then not ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved. And it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this, how Gods goodneſſe ſtrives with mans refractorineſſe; Man would ſit down at this world, God bids him ſell it, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a better: Juſt as a Father, who hath in his hand an apple, and a piece of Gold under it; the Child comes, and with pulling, gets the apple out of his Fathers hand: his Father bids him throw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he will give him the gold for it, which the Child utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, eats it, and is troubled with wormes: So is the carnall and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> The Parſon in Liberty.</head>
                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the manifold wiles of Satan (who playes his part ſometimes in drawing Gods Servants from him, ſometimes in perplexing them in the ſervice of God) ſtands faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free. This Liberty he compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by one diſtinction, and that is, of what is Neceſſary, and what is Additionary. As for example: It is neceſſary, that all Chriſtians ſhould pray twice a day, every day of the week, and four times on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170662:101"/> Sunday, if they be well. This is ſo neceſſary, and eſſentiall to a Chriſtian, that he cannot without this maintain himſelf in a Chriſtian ſtate. Beſides this, the Godly have ever added ſome houres of prayer, as at nine, or at three, or at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or as they think fit, &amp; ſee cauſe, or rather as Gods ſpirit leads them. But theſe prayers are not neceſſary, but additionary. Now it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the godly petitioner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome emergent interruption in the day, or by overſleeping himſelf at night, omits his additionary prayer. Upon this his mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be perplexed, and troubled, and Satan, who knows the exigent, blows the fire, endeavouring to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Chriſtian, and put him out of his ſtation, and to inlarge the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, untill it ſpread, and taint his other duties of piety, which none can perform ſo wel in trouble, as in calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Here the Parſon interpoſeth with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170662:101"/> his diſtinction, and ſhews the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Chriſtian, that this prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing additionary, not neceſſary; taken in, not commanded, the omiſsion thereof upon juſt occaſion ought by no means trouble him. God knows the occaſion as wel as he, and He is as a gracious Father, who more accepts a common courſe of devotion, then diſlikes an occaſionall interruption. And of this he is ſo to aſſure himſelf, as to admit no ſcruple, but to go on as cheerfully, as if he had not been interrupted. By this it is evident, that the diſtinction is of ſingular uſe and comfort, eſpecially to pious minds, which are ever tender, and delicate. But here there are two Cautions to be added. Firſt, that this interruption proceed not out of ſlacknes, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which will appear if the Pious ſoul foreſee and prevent ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, what he may, before they come, and when for all that they do come, he be a little affected
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170662:102"/> therewith, but not afflicted, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; if he reſent it to a miſlike, but not a griefe. Secondly, that this interruption proceede not out of ſhame. As for example: A godly man, not out of ſuperſtition, but of reverence to Gods houſe, reſolves whenever he enters into a Church, to kneel down, and pray, either bleſſing God, that he will be pleaſed to dwell among men; or beſeeching him, that whenever he repaires to his houſe, he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf ſo as befits ſo great a preſence; and this briefly. But it happens, that neer the place where he is to pray, he ſpyes ſome ſcoffing ruffian, who is likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride him for his paines: if he now, ſhall either for fear or ſhame, break his cuſtome, he ſhall do paſſing ill: ſo much the rather ought he to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as that by this he may take into his Prayer humiliation alſo. On the other ſide, if I am to viſit
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170662:102"/> the ſick in haſte, and my neereſt way ly through the Church, I will not doubt to go without ſtaying to pray there (but onely, as I paſſe, in my heart) becauſe this kinde of Prayer is additionary, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the other duty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs it: So that if any ſcruple ariſe, I will throw it away, and be moſt confident, that God is not diſpleaſed. This diſtinction may runne through all Chriſtian duties, and it is a great ſtay and ſetling to religious ſouls.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon hath not onely taken a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Servey of the faults of his own Pariſh, but a generall alſo of the diſeaſes of the time, that ſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170662:103"/> when his occaſions carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or bring ſtrangers to him, he may be the better armed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. The great and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſin of this Land he eſteems to be Idleneſſe; great in it ſelfe, and great in Conſequence: For when men have nothing to do, then they fall to drink, to ſteal, to whore, to ſcoffe, to revile, to all ſorts of gamings. Come, ſay they, we have nothing to do, lets go to the Tavern, or to the ſtews, or what not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parſon ſtrongly oppoſeth this ſin, wherſoever he goes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Idleneſs is twofold, the one in having no calling, the other in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king careleſly in our calling, he firſt repreſents to every body the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a vocation. The reaſon of this aſſertion is taken from the nature of man, wherein God hath placed two great Inſtruments, Reaſon in the ſoul, and a hand in the Body, as ingagements of working: So
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170662:103"/> that even in Paradiſe man had a calling, and how much more out of Paradiſe, when the evills which he is now ſubject unto, may be prevented, or diverted by reaſonable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, every gift or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is a talent to be accounted for, and to be improved to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Advantage. Yet is it alſo a debt to our Countrey to have a Calling, and it concernes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that none ſhould be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but all buſied. Laſtly, riches are the bleſsing of God, and the great Inſtrument of doing admirable good; therfore all are to procure them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and ſeaſonably, when they are not better imployed. Now this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon croſſeth not our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſelling what we have, becauſe when we have ſold all, and given it to the poor, we muſt not be idle, but labour to get more, that we may give more, according to St <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11, 12.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170662:104"/> ſo that our Saviours ſelling is ſo far from croſſing Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> working, that it rather eſtabliſheth it, ſince they that have nothing, are fitteſt to work. Now becauſe the onely oppoſer to this Doctrine is the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, who is witty enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe both others, and himſelf, and who is ready to ask, if he ſhall mend ſhoos, or what he ſhall do? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parſon unmoved, ſheweth, that <hi>ingenuous and fit</hi> imployment is never wanting to thoſe that ſeek it. But if it ſhould be, the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands thus: All are eitheir to have a Calling, or prepare for it: He that hath or can have yet no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, if he truly, and ſeriouſly prepare for it, he is ſafe and within bounds. Wherefore all are either preſently to enter into a Calling, if they be fit for it, and it for them; or elſe to examine with care, and advice, what they are fitteſt for, and to prepare for that with all diligence.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170662:104"/> But it will not be amiſſe in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſefull point to deſcend to particulars: for exactneſſe lyes in particulars. Men are either ſingle, or marryed: The marryed and houſe-keeper hath his hands full, if he do what he ought to do. For there are two branches of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; firſt, the improvement of his family, by bringing them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord; and ſecondly, the improvement of his grounds, by drowning, or draining, ſtocking, or fencing, and ordering his land to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage both of himſelf, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The <hi>Italian</hi> ſays, None fouls his hands in his own buſineſſe: and it is an honeſt, and juſt care, ſo it exceed not bounds, for every one to imploy himſelfe to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his affairs, that hee may have wherewithall to do good. But his family is his beſt care, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Chriſtian ſoules, and raiſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170662:105"/> them to their height, even to heaven; to dreſſe and prune them, and take as much joy in a ſtraight-growing childe, or ſervant, as a Gardiner doth in a choice tree. Could men finde out this delight, they would ſeldome be from home; whereas now, of any place, they are leaſt there. But if after all this care well diſpatched, the houſe-keepers Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſo ſmall, and his dexterity ſo great, that he have leiſure to look out, the Village or Pariſh which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lives in, or is neer unto it, is his imployment. Hee conſiders every one there, and either helps them in particular, or hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Propoſitions to the whole Towne or Hamlet, of advancing the publick Stock, and managing Commons, or Woods, according as the place ſuggeſts.

Wherefore it behoves all, who are come to the gravitie, and ripeneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo excellent a Place, not to refuſe, but rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. And whereas there are uſually three Objections made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Place; the one, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of it, by taking petty-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-bribes; the other, the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it on mean perſons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſome Shires: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the trouble of it; Theſe are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170662:106"/> ſo far from deterring any good man from the place, that they kindle them rather to redeem the Dignity either from true faults, or unjuſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions. Now, for ſingle men, they are either Heirs, or younger Brothers: The Heirs are to prepare in all the fore-mentioned points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time of their practice. Therefore they are to mark their Fathers diſcretion in ordering his Houſe and Affairs; and alſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when they ſee any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able point of Education or good husbandry, and to tranſplant it in time to his own home, with the ſame care as others, when they meet with good fruit, get a graffe of the tree, inriching their Orchard, and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their Houſe. Beſides, they are to read Books of Law, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; eſpecially, the Statutes at large. As for better Books of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, they are not in this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe we are about a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170662:106"/> and a preparation thereunto. But chiefly, and above all things, they are to frequent Seſſions and Sizes; for it is both an honor which they owe to the Reverend Judges and Magiſtrates, to attend them, at leaſt in their Shire; and it is a great advantage to know the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Land; for our Law is Practice. Sometimes he may go to Court, as the eminent place both of good and ill. At other times he is to travell over the King's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cutting out the Kingdome into Portions, which every yeer he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys peece-meal. When there is a Parliament, he is to endeavour by all means to be a Knight or Burgeſs there; for there is no School to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And when he is there, he muſt not only be a morning man, but at Committees alſo; for there the particulars are exactly diſcuſſed, which are brought from thence to the Houſe but in generall. When
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170662:107"/> none of theſe occaſions call him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, every morning that hee is at home hee muſt either ride the Great Horſe, or exerciſe ſome of his Military geſtures. For all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that are not weakned, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed with ſedentary lives, are to know the uſe of their Arms: and as the Husbandman labours for them, ſo muſt they fight for, and defend them, when occaſion calls. This is the duty of each to other, which they ought to fulfill: And the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a lover and exciter to juſtice in all things, even as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſquared out to every one (even to Souldiers) what to do. As for younger Brothers, thoſe whom the Parſon finds looſe, and not ingaged into ſome Profeſſion by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe neglect in this point is intolerable, and a ſhamefull wrong both to the Common-wealth, and their own Houſe: To them, after he hath ſhewd the unlawfulneſs of ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Secondly, he commends the Mathematicks, as the only wonder working know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and therefore requiring the beſt ſpirits. After the ſeverall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of theſe, he adviſeth to inſiſt and dwell chiefly on the two noble branches therof, of Fortification, and Navigation; The one being uſefull to all Countreys, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſpecially to Ilands. But if the young Gallant think theſe Courſes dull, and phlegmatick, where can he buſie himſelf better, then in thoſe new Plantations, and diſcoveryes, which are not only a noble, but alſo as they may be handled, a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170662:108"/> imployment? Or let him travel into <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and obſerving the Artifices, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures there, tranſplant them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as divers have done lately, to our Countrey's advantage.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary is a holy Life: for beſides the bleſsing that that brings upon it, there being a promiſe, that if the Kingdome of God be firſt ſought, all other things ſhall be added, even it ſelfe is a Sermon. For the temptations with which a good man is beſet, and the ways which he uſed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, being told to another, whether in private conference, or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170662:108"/> in the Church, are a Sermon. Hee that hath conſidered how to carry himſelf at table about his appetite, if he tell this to another, preacheth; and much more feelingly, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, then he writes his rules of temperance out of bookes. So that the Parſon having ſtudied, and maſtered all his luſts and affections within, and the whole Army of Temptations without, hath ever ſo many ſermons ready penn'd, as he hath victories. And it fares in this as it doth in Phyſick: He that hath been ſick of a Conſumption, and knows what recovered him, is a Phyſitian ſo far as he meetes with the ſame diſeaſe, and temper; and can much better, and particularly do it, then he that is generally lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and was never ſick. And if the ſame perſon had been ſick of all diſeaſes, and were recovered of all by things that he knew; there were no ſuch Phyſician as he, both for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170662:109"/> skill and tenderneſſe. Juſt ſo it is in Divinity, and that not without manifeſt reaſon: for though the temptations may be diverſe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Chriſtians, yet the victory is alike in all, being by the ſelf-ſame Spirit. Neither is this true onely in the military ſtate of a Chriſtian life, but even in the peaceable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; when the ſervant of God, freed for a while from temptation, in a quiet ſweetneſſe ſeeks how to pleaſe his God. Thus the Parſon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that repentance is the great vertue of the Goſpel, and one of the firſt ſteps of pleaſing God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his owne uſe examined the nature of it, is able to explaine it after to others. And particularly, having doubted ſometimes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his repentance were true, or at leaſt in that degree it ought to be, ſince he found himſelfe ſometimes to weepe more for the loſſe of ſome temporall things, then for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170662:109"/> God, he came at length to this reſolution, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is an act of the mind, not of the Body, even as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſignifies; and that the chiefe thing, which God in Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is the heart, and the ſpirit, and to worſhip him in truth, and ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore in caſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian endeavour to weep, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, ſince we are not Maſters of our bodies, this ſufficeth. And conſequently he found, that the eſſence of repentance, that it may be alike in all Gods children (which as concerning weeping it cannot be, ſome being of a more melting tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then others) conſiſteth in a true deteſtation of the ſoul, abhorring, and renouncing ſin, and turning unto God in truth of heart, and newneſſe of life: Which acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are and muſt be found in all Gods ſervants: Not that weeping is not uſefull, where it can be, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170662:110"/> ſo the body may joyn in the grief, as it did in the ſin; but that, ſo the other acts be, that is not neceſſary: ſo that he as truly repents, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the other acts of repentance, when he cannot more, as he that weeps a floud of tears. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and comfort the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon getting for himſelf, when he tels it to others, becomes a Sermon. The like he doth in other Chriſtian vertues, as of faith, and Love, and the Caſes of Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto, wherein (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> implyes that he ought, <hi>Romans</hi> 2.) hee firſt preacheth to himſelfe, and then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> The Parſon's Dexterity in applying of Remedies.</head>
                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon knows, that there is a double ſtate of a Chriſtian even in this Life, the one military, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peaceable. The military is, when we are aſſaulted with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either from within or from without. The Peaceable is, when the Divell for a time leaves us, as he did our Saviour, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels miniſter to us their owne food, even joy, and peace; and comfort in the holy Ghoſt. Theſe two ſtates were in our Saviour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning of his preaching, but afterwards alſo, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.35.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170662:111"/> He was tempted: And <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. He rejoyced in Spirit: And they muſt be likewiſe in all that are his. Now the Parſon having a Spirituall Judgement, according as he diſcovers any of his Flock to be in one or the other ſtate, ſo he applies himſelfe to them. Thoſe that he findes in the peaceable ſtate, he adviſeth to be very vigilant, and not to let go the raines as ſoon as the horſe goes eaſie. Particularly, he counſelleth them to two things: Firſt, to take heed, leſt their qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et betray them (as it is apt to do) to a coldneſſe, and careleſneſſe in their devotions, but to labour ſtill to be as fervent in Chriſtian Duties, as they remember themſelves were, when affliction did blow the Coals. Secondly, not to take the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and liberty of their Peace: not to eate of all thoſe diſhes at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which even their preſent health otherwiſe admits; nor to ſtore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170662:111"/> their houſe with all thoſe furnitures which even their preſent plenty of wealth otherwiſe admits; nor when they are among them that are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to extend themſelves to all that mirth, which the preſent occaſion of wit, and company otherwiſe admits; but to put bounds, and hoopes to their joyes: ſo will they laſt the longer, and when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, returne the ſooner. If we would judg ourſelves, we ſhould not be judged; and if we would bound our ſelves, we ſhould not be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But if they ſhall fear, that at ſuch, or ſuch a time their peace and mirth have carryed them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this moderation, then to take <hi>Jobs</hi> admirable Courſe, who ſacrificed leſt his Children ſhould have tranſgreſſed in their mirth: So let them go, and find ſome poore afflicted ſoul, and there be bountifull, and liberall; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170662:112"/> Thoſe that the Parſon findes in the military ſtate, he fortifyes, and ſtrengthens with his utmoſt skill. Now in thoſe that are tempted, whatſoever is unruly, falls upon two heads; either they think, that there is none that can or will look after things, but all goes by chance, or wit: Or elſe, though there be a great Governour of all things, yet to them he is loſt, as if they ſaid, God doth forſake and perſecute them, and there is none to deliver them. If the Parſon ſuſpect the firſt, and find ſparkes of ſuch thoughts now and then to break forth, then without oppoſing directly (for diſputation is no Cure for Atheiſme) he ſcatters in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe three ſorts of arguments; the firſt taken from Nature, the ſecond from the Law, the third from Grace. For Nature, he ſees not how a houſe could be either built without a builder, or kept in repaire
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170662:112"/> without a houſe-keeper. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not poſſibly, how the windes ſhould blow ſo much as they can, and the ſea rage as much as it can, and all things do what they can, and all, not only without diſſolution of the whole, but alſo of any part, by taking away ſo much as the uſuall ſeaſons of ſummer and winter, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and harveſt. Let the weather be what it will, ſtill we have bread, though ſometimes more, ſomtimes leſſe; wherewith alſo a carefull <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> might meet. He conceives not poſſibly, how he that would beleeve a Divinity, if he had been at the Creation of all things, ſhould leſſe beleeve it, ſeeing the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things; For Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a Creation; and more, it is a continued Creation, and a creation every moment. Secondly, for the Law, there may be ſo evident, though unuſed a proof of Divinity taken from thence, that the Atheiſt,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170662:113"/> or Epicurian can have nothing to contradict. The Jewes yet live, and are known: they have their Law and Language bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them, and they to it: they are Circumciſed to this day, and expect the promiſes of the Scripture; their Countrey alſo is known, the places, and rivers travelled unto, and frequented by others, but to them an unpenetrable rock, an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsible deſert. Wherefore if the Jewes live, all the great wonders of old live in them, and then who can deny the ſtretched out arme of a mighty God? eſpecially ſince it may be a juſt doubt, whether, conſidering the ſtubbornneſſe of the Nation, their living then in their Countrey under ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were a ſtranger thing, then their preſent exile, and diſability to live in their Countrey. And it is obſervable, that this very thing was intended by God, that the Jewes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170662:113"/> ſhould be his proof, and witneſſes, as he calls them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.12. And their very diſperſion in all Lands, was intended not only for a puniſhment to them; but for an exciting of others by their ſight, to the acknowledging of God, and his power, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 59.11. And therefore this kind of Puniſhment was choſen rather then any other. Thirdly, for Grace. Beſides the continuall ſucceſſion (ſince the Goſpell) of holy men, who have born witneſs to the truth, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reaſon, why any ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> more then <hi>Tully, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill,</hi> or <hi>Livy;</hi>) There are two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies in the Goſpel, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently argue Chriſts Divinity by their ſucceſs: the one concerning the woman that ſpent the oyntment on our Saviour, for which he told, that it ſhould never be forgotten, but with the Goſpel it ſelfe be preached
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170662:114"/> to all ages, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. The other concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid, that that generation ſhould not paſſe, till all were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.32. Which <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> his ſtory confirmeth, and the continuance of which verdict is yet evident. To theſe might be added the Preaching of the Goſpel in all Nations, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.14. which we ſee even miraculouſly effected in theſe new diſcoveryes, God turning mens Covetouſneſſe, and Ambitions to the effecting of his word. Now a propheſie is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſent to Poſterity, leaſt they complaine of want of wonders. It is a letter ſealed, and ſent, which to the bearer is but paper, but to the receiver, and opener, is full of power. Hee that ſaw Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a blind mans eyes, ſaw not more Divinity, then he that reads the womans oyntment in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170662:114"/> or ſees <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſtroyed. With ſome of theſe heads enlarged, and woven into his diſcourſe, at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times and occaſions, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſetleth wavering minds. But if he ſees them neerer deſperation, then Atheiſme, not ſo much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God, as that he is theirs; then he dives unto the boundleſſe Ocean of Gods Love, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable riches of his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He hath one argument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable. If God hate them, either he doth it as they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, duſt and aſhes; or as they are ſinfull. As Creatures, he muſt needs love them; for no perfect Artiſt ever yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his owne worke. As ſinfull, he muſt much more love them; becauſe notwithſtanding his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite hate of ſinne, his Love over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came that hate; and with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great victory; which in the Creation needed not, gave
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170662:115"/> them love for love, even the ſon of his love out of his boſome of love. So that man, which way ſoever he turnes, hath two pledges of Gods Love, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed; the one in his being, the other in his ſinfull being: and this as the more faulty in him, ſo the more glorious in God. And all may certainly conclude, that God loves them, till either they deſpiſe that Love, or deſpaire of his Mercy: not any ſin elſe, but is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Love; but the deſpiſing of Love muſt needs be without it. The thruſting away of his arme makes us onely not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>

                     <p>THe Countrey Parſon is a Lover of old Cuſtomes, if they be good, and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; and the rather, becauſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people are much addicted to them, ſo that to favour them therein is to win their hearts, and to oppoſe them therin is to deject them. If there be any ill in the cuſtome, that may be ſevered from the good, he pares the apple, and gives them the clean to feed on. Particularly, he loves Proceſsion, and maintains it, becauſe there are contained therein 4 mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt advantages. Firſt, a bleſsing of God for the fruits of the field: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, juſtice in the Preſervation of bounds: Thirdly, Charity in loving
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170662:116"/> walking, and neighbourly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying one another, with recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of differences at that time, if there be any: Fourthly, Mercy in releeving the poor by a liberall diſtribution and largeſſe, which at that time is, or ought to be uſed. Wherefore he exacts of all to bee preſent at the perambulation, and thoſe that withdraw, and ſever themſelves from it, he miſlikes, and reproves as uncharitable, and unneighbourly; and if they will not reforme, preſents them. Nay, he is ſo farre from condemning ſuch aſſemblies, that he rather procures them to be often, as knowing that abſence breedes ſtrangeneſs, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence love. Now Love is his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and aime; wherefore he likes well, that his Pariſh at good times invite one another to their houſes, and he urgeth them to it: and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, where he knowes there hath been or is a little difference, hee
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170662:116"/> takes one of the parties, and goes with him to the other, and all dine or ſup together. There is much preaching in this friendlineſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother old Cuſtome there is of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when light is brought in, God ſend us the light of heaven; And the Parſon likes this very well; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he affraid of praiſing, or praying to God at all times, but is rather glad of catching opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to do them. Light is a great Bleſſing, and as great as food, for which we give thanks: and thoſe that thinke this ſuperſtitious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know ſuperſtition, nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As for thoſe that are aſhamed to uſe this forme, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, and obſolete, and not the faſhion, he reformes, and teaches them, that at Baptiſme they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed not to be aſhamed of Chriſts Croſs, or for any ſhame to leave that which is good. He that is aſhamed in ſmall things, will extend his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170662:117"/> to greater. Rather ſhould a Chriſtian Souldier take ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to harden himſelfe, and to further his exerciſes of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170662:117"/> a Miniſter, that it deſerves reproof, not refutation: Or elſe, becauſe they think it empty and ſuperfluous. But that which the Apoſtles uſed ſo diligently in their writings, nay, which our Saviour himſelfe uſed, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.16, cannot bee vain and ſuperfluous. But this was not proper to Chriſt, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles only, no more then to be a ſpirituall Father was appropriated to them. And if temporall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſe their children, how much more may, and ought Spirituall Fathers? Beſides, the Prieſts of the old Teſtament were commanded to Bleſſe the people, and the forme thereof is preſcribed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. Now as the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in another caſe; if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of condemnation did bleſs, how ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit exceed in bleſsing? The fruit of this bleſsing good <hi>Hannah</hi> found, and received with great joy,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170662:118"/> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. though it came from a man diſallowed by God: for it was not the perſon, but Prieſthood, that bleſſed; ſo that even ill Prieſts may bleſſe.

So in the old Teſtament <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> curſed the children, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.24. which though our Saviour reproved as unfitting for his particular, who was to ſhew all humility before his Paſſion, yet he allows in his Apoſtles.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170662:118"/> of Bleſſing, &amp; curſing are expounded in the Common-Prayer-book: the one in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. and: The Peace of God, &amp;c. The other in generall, in the Commination. Now bleſſing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from prayer, in aſſurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not performed by way of requeſt, but of confidence, and power, effectually applying Gods favour to the bleſſed, by the intereſting of that dignity wherewith God hath inveſted the Prieſt, and ingaging of Gods own power and inſtitution for a bleſsing. The neglect of this duty in Miniſters themſelves, hath made the people alſo neglect it; ſo that they are ſo far from craving this benefit from their ghoſtly Father, that they oftentimes goe out of church, before he hath bleſſed them. In the time of Popery, the Prieſts <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicite,</hi> and his holy water were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver highly valued; and now we are fallen to the clean contrary, even

And it is obſervable, that if a Miniſter talke with a great man in the ordinary courſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing language, he ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as ordinary complementers; but if he often interpoſe a Bleſſing, when the other gives him juſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, by ſpeaking any good, this unuſuall form begets a reverence, and makes him eſteemed according to his Profeſſion. The ſame is to be obſerved in writing Letters alſo. To conclude, if all men are to bleſſe upon occaſion, as appears <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. how much more thoſe, who are ſpiritual Fathers?</p>

Now the Parſon taking this point to task, which is ſo exceeding uſeful, and hath taken ſo deep roote, that it ſeems the very life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Converſation, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus far in the diſcuſsing of it. Faults are either notorious, or private. Again notorious faults are either ſuch as are made known by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame (and of theſe, thoſe that know them, may talk, ſo they do it not with ſport, but commiſeration;) or elſe ſuch as have paſſed judgment, &amp; been corrected either by whipping, or impriſoning, or the like. Of theſe alſo men may talk, and more, they may diſcover them to thoſe that know them not: becauſe infamy is a part of the ſentence againſt malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, which the Law intends, as is evident by thoſe, which are branded for rogues, that they may be known; or put into the ſtocks, that they may be looked upon. But ſome may
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170662:120"/> ſay, though the Law allow this, the Goſpel doth not, which hath ſo much advanced Charity, and ranked backbiters among the generation of the wicked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. But this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered: As the executioner is not uncharitable, that takes away the life of the condemned, except beſides his office, he add a tincture of private malice in the joy, and haſt of acting his part; ſo neither is he that defames him, whom the Law would have defamed, except he alſo do it out of rancour. For in infamy, all are executioners, and the Law gives a malefactour to all to be defamed. And as malefactors may loſe &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their goods, or life; ſo may they their good name, and the poſſeſsion thereof, which before therr offence, and Judgment they had in all mens breſts: for all are honeſt, till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be proved. Beſides, it concerns the Common-Wealth, that Rogues ſhould be known and Charity to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170662:121"/> publick hath the precedence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate charity. So that it is ſo far from being a fault to diſcover ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that it is a duty rather, which may do much good, and ſave much harme. Nevertheleſſe, if the puniſhed delinquent ſhall be much troubled for his ſins, and turne quite another man, doubtleſſe then alſo mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and words muſt turne, and forbear to ſpeak of that, which even God himſelf hath forgotten.</p>

                     <hi>O</hi> Almighty and ever-living Lord God! Majeſty, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Brightneſſe, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! How ſhall we dare to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy face, who are contrary to thee, in all we call thee? for we are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and weakneſſe, and filthineſſe, and ſhame. Miſery and ſin fill our days: yet art thou our Creatour, and we thy work: Thy hands both made us, and alſo made us Lords of all thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; giving us one world in our ſelves, and another to ſerve us: then did'ſt thou place us in Paradiſe, and <hi>wert</hi> proceeding ſtill on in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, untill we interrupted thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, diſappointed thy Purpoſes, and ſold our God, our glorious, our gracious God for an apple. O write it! O brand it in our foreheads for ever: for an apple once we loſt our God, and ſtill
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170662:159"/> loſe him for no more; for money, for meat, for diet: But thou Lord, art patience, and pity, and ſweetneſſe, and love; therefore we ſons of men are not conſumed. Thou haſt exalted thy mercy above all things; and haſt made our ſalvation, not our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thy glory: ſo that then where ſin abounded, not death, but grace ſuper abounded; accordingly, when we had ſinned beyond any help in heaven or earth, then thou ſaideſt; Lo, I come! then did the Lord of life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of himſelfe to die, contrive to do it. He took fleſh, he wept, he died; for his enemies he died; even for thoſe that derided him then, and ſtill deſpiſe him. Bleſſed Saviour! ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters could not quench thy love! nor no pit overwhelme it. But though the ſtreams of thy bloud were currant through darkneſſe, grave, and hell; yet by theſe thy conflicts, and <hi>ſeemingly</hi> hazards, didſt thou ariſe triumphant, and therein mad'ſt us victorious.</p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:170662:159"/>
                  <p>Neither doth thy love yet ſtay here! for; this word of thy rich peace, and reconciliation, thou haſt committed, not to Thunder, or Angels, but to ſilly and ſinfull men: even to me, pardoning my ſins, and bidding me go feed the people of thy love.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the God of Heaven and Earth! who onely doth wondrous things. Awake therefore, my Lute, and my Viol! awake all my powers to glorifie thee! We praiſe thee! we bleſſe thee! we magnifie thee for ever! And now, O Lord! in the power of thy Victories, and in the wayes of thy Ordinances, and in the truth of thy Love, Lo, we ſtand here, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to bleſſe thy word, wher-ever ſpoken this day throughout the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church. O make it a word of power and peace, to convert thoſe who are not yet thine, and to confirme thoſe that are: particularly, bleſſe it in this thy own Kingdom, which thou haſt made a Land of light, a ſtore-houſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170662:160"/> of thy treaſures and mercies: O let not our fooliſh and unworthy hearts rob us of the continuance of this thy ſweet love: but pardon our ſins, and perfect what thou haſt begun. Ride on Lord, becauſe of the word of truth, and meekneſſe, and righteouſneſſe; and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things. Eſpecially, bleſſe this portion here aſſembled together, with thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Servant ſpeaking unto them: Lord Jeſu! teach thou me, that I may teach them: Sanctifie, and inable all my powers, that in their full ſtrength they may deliver thy meſſage reverently, readily, faithfully, &amp; fruitfully. O make thy word a ſwift word, paſsing from the ear to the heart, from the heart to the life and converſation: that as the rain returns not empty, ſo neither may thy word, but accompliſh that for which it is given. O Lord hear, O Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give! O Lord, hearken, and do ſo for thy bleſſed Son's ſake, in whoſe ſweet and pleaſing words, we ſay, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>BLeſſed be God! and the Father of all mercy! who continueth to pour his benefits upon us. Thou haſt elected us, thou haſt called us, thou haſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us, ſanctified, and glorified us: Thou waſt born for us, and thou livedſt and diedſt for us: Thou haſt given us the bleſsings of this life, and of a better. O Lord! thy bleſsings hang in cluſters, they come trooping upon us! they break forth like mighty waters on every ſide. And now Lord, thou haſt fed us with the bread of life: ſo man did eat Angel's food: O Lord, beſſe it: O Lord, make it health and ſtrength unto us: ſtill ſtriving &amp; proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering ſo long within us, untill our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>reach</hi> thy meaſure of thy love, who haſt done for us as much as may be.

                  </head>
                  <p>MY dear and deſerving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, your <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> I now return with many thanks, and ſome notes; in which perhaps you will diſover ſome care, which I forbear not in the midſt of my griefes; firſt, for your ſake, becauſe I would do nothing negligently that you commit unto me: ſecondly,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170662:161"/> for the Authour's ſake, whom I conceive to have been a true ſervant of God; and to ſuch, and all that is theirs, I owe diligence: Thirdly, for the Churches ſake, to whom by printing it, I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it. You owe the Church a debt, and God hath put this into your hands, (as he ſent the fiſh with money to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>) to diſcharge it: happily alſo with this, (as his thoughts are fruitfull,) intending the honour of his ſervant the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, who being obſcured in his own Countrey, he would have to flouriſh in this Land of light, and Region of the Goſpel, among his choſen. It is true, there are ſome things which I like not in him, as my fragments will expreſſe, when you read them; nevertheleſſe, I wiſh you by all means to publiſh it, for theſe three eminent things obſervable therein: Firſt, that God in the midſt of Popery ſhould open the eys
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170662:162"/> of one to underſtand and expreſſe ſo clearly and excellently the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Goſpel, in the acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, (as he ſheweth through all his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,) a thing ſtrangely buried and darkned by the Adverſaries, and their great ſtumbling block. Secondly, the great honour and reverence, which he every where bears towards our great Maſter, and Lord, concluding every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration almoſt with his holy Name, and ſetting his merit forth ſo piouſly; for which I do ſo love him, that were there nothing elſe, I would print it, that with it the honour of my Lord might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. Thirdly, the many pious rules of ordering our life, about mortification, and obſervation of God's Kingdome within us, and the working thereof, of which he was a very diligent obſerver. Theſe three things are very eminent in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170662:162"/> the Authour, and over-weigh the defects, as I conceive, towards the publiſhing thereof.</p>
